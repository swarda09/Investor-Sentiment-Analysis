Digital, Healthcare and Telecom will continue to have a good run in 2021: All these themes were promising even before COVID 19 but the pandemic has resulted in business transformation decisions which were unthinkable a year back. IT companies in India are winning big transformational deals which will have huge implications over the next few years. Similarly, healthcare and telecom sectors have seen massive changes. Business models are set to evolve further and stocks in these sectors will continue to outperform in 2021.Year of small and mid caps: After a prolonged period of weakness, the small and midcap stocks have outperformed the large cap indices by a significant margin. The year 2021 will be a year of economic revival with GDP growth rate closer to double digits. Notwithstanding the low base, the economic revival will usher stronger earnings growth. In a year of strong earnings growth, mid and small caps tend to see market beating earnings growth and rerating. Small and mid cap stocks are likely to deliver very strong returns and when combined with other dominant themes then returns will be even stronger.BFSI and Atmanirbhar to see strong traction: The immense liquidity within banking system has meant that the sector is now focused on growth. NPAs are likely to be contained well and the banks have raised enough capital to tide over the stress challenges. As growth becomes the focus for banks, stock returns will track credit growth and pre provision profits which are likely to be significant. Apart from BFSI, the Union Budget for 2021 will be very critical with major schemes for manufacturing companies expected. This could mean a wide range of Atmanirbhar (self-sufficiency) schemes are in the fray. This could help the manufacturing sector immensely.Sector rotation and impetus on infrastructure will be critical: Equities have seen significant flow of FII liquidity and solid sector rotation theme playing out. Even PSUs have started performing in the last couple of months as they were immensely undervalued. Sector rotation theme is likely to play out in the early part of 2021 as underperforming sectors like FMCG could gain traction. Also, budget could put more thrust on the infrastructure sector as that is the key for creating jobs. Thus, sector rotation and selective plays related to infra could deliver good returns in 2021.

Now what?","Indian markets ended the last day of 2020 on a dull note but logged strong gains for the year. Nifty ended flat at 13,981 while Sensex settled marginally higher at 47,751. For the year, Nifty rose about 15%, its best performance in three years. Intra-day, Nifty hit 14,000 levels for the first time.  ""We were successful in claiming the 14000 marks but closed below it. There might be a psychological resistance at this level. However, the trend remains bullish and we should be headed higher to 14100-14150 sooner than later. The current support is at 13500-13600 and since the risk-reward is skewed at this juncture, a buy on dips strategy is advised with strict trailing stops,"" said Manish Hathiramani, proprietary index trader and technical analyst at Deen Dayal Investments. The Nifty Phrama index, which has been the best performer among the main sub-indexes, gaining about 60% so far in 2020, ended 0.72% higher today. ""For the trend following traders 13935 should be the sacrosanct level to watch. Trading below the same we can expect quick correction up to 13875-13850 On the flip side, 14025 would be the immediate hurdle for the day traders, above the same we could expect further uptrend till 14075-14125,” said Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research at Kotak Securities. The Nifty IT index, which has rallied more than 55% so far in 2020, was down 0.32% for the day. Outlook for 2021: Here is what some experts say Dhiraj Relli, MD & CEO, HDFC Securities ""The continuation of low or zero interest rates globally can keep pushing valuations higher for the world as well as for India. But this ride has to be taken keeping in mind the possibility of sudden and sharp reversal. Smaller companies run lean compared to large companies and tend to do well in times of rapid growth in the economy and high inflation. Over the next six months, as vaccines roll out, the market could continue to broaden and favour small caps and value stocks."" Jaideep Hansraj, MD & CEO, Kotak Securities ""We see markets behaving differently in first half and second half of CY21. Q3 earnings season could turn to be strong due to healthy advance tax figures and also lead to some earnings upgrades. We can expect Nifty to go anywhere between 14,000 & 15,000 range sometime in first quarter of CY21. Post budget and Q4 result season we expect markets to go into some kind of consolidation phase and witness time correction. We expect moderation in monetary policies and rising yields scenario in 2HCY21, which will lead to mean reversion of valuations towards 10/15 year averages. Based on these thesis we have used the previous 15 years peak of 19x Fw PE multiple to value the Nifty-50 to derive at our CY21 end target. We expect Nifty-50 to end CY21 somewhere around 13,500 and BSE Sensex to end at about 46,000."" B Gopkumar, MD & CEO, Axis Securities, ""The year 2020 was a rollercoaster ride, to say the least. The stock markets in 2020 witnessed a fascinating trend. As the market corrected significantly, retail investors started buying quality stocks realizing the value in these companies. Also, lockdown resulted in more people taking to the equity markets and learning nuances. This shift has significant long term implications as more and more participants will be seen in 2021. The year 2020 also showed us the resilience of the Indian economy. We performed much better than most developed countries that have far superior health care facilities. Even with a lockdown in place, the Indian corporates managed their cost structure very well and adapted to the conditions better than expectations. India has seen multiple shocks over the last 15 years, due to which the economy has become more resilient, and the pandemic has made it even more resilient. 2021 will be a year of growth. We expect the GDP growth rate in 2021 to be closer to double digits, and earnings growth to be 30%+ for India Inc. Union Budget in 2021 could also be a blockbuster. Putting these perspectives together, we are likely to see a robust 2021."" Catch all the Business News ,  Market News , Breaking News Events and Latest News  Updates on Live Mint.

Invest Now Index and exchange traded funds (ETFs) have been getting a lot of attention from investors in the past few years.  Actively-managed large-cap funds have found it difficult to outperform their benchmark indices such as the Nifty 50. This also led to many fund houses rolling out fresh passive schemes based on other indices as well. But there is one index that stands out in terms of performance and its future potential. Enter Nifty Next 50, or the Nifty Junior index as it was previously called. Currently, there are 12 passively managed Nifty Next 50 funds available in the market – six each from index funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Their combined assets went up around three-fold over the last two years to Rs 4,393 crore. Here are five reasons why you must own at least one passively-managed Nifty Next 50 scheme in your portfolio. Nifty Next 50 outruns large-cap and mid-cap indices The Nifty Next 50 index represents 50 companies from the NIFTY 100 index after excluding the NIFTY 50 companies. Some companies eventually graduate to being a part of the Nifty 50 index. Some Nifty Next 50 companies also get demoted to lower-rung indices. That said, the Nifty Next 50 has given impressive returns, consistently. It not only does well against the Nifty 50 index, but also compares well to mid-cap indices. Over the last 10-year period, the Nifty Next 50 total returns index (TRI) delivered 11.6 per cent returns (compounded). The Nifty 50 TRI gave 9.9 per cent. On a rolling returns basis, too, the Nifty Next 50 scores over the Nifty 50 as well as the Nifty Midcap 150 (TRI). We looked at the indices’ five-year returns over a total period of 15 years.  Diversification, with a midcap flavour The Nifty Next 50 is typically a better diversified index than the Nifty 50. Anil Ghelani, Head of Passive Investments & Products at DSP Investment Managers says that Nifty 50 often sees some of its top holdings crossing 10 percent each. Nifty Next 50, on the other hand, typically doesn’t see its largest holdings cross even 5 percent. “The top 10 holdings in the Nifty Next 50 index are typically around 35-40 percent; in the case of Nifty 50, they are around 60 percent,” says Ghelani. So, in comparison, the Nifty Next 50 Index is more diversified, with less concentration risk across stocks and sectors. The Nifty Next 50 often has a few mid-cap stocks as well, which typically make up 8-10 percent of the portfolio.”  Defensive in nature The sector composition of Nifty Next 50 also offers good diversification to your Nifty 50 based passively-managed schemes. A look at Nifty Next 50 index tells us that its top holdings are in growth-styled companies in typically defensive sectors. The total weight of consumer non-durables, pharmaceutical and other utilities sectors is around 46 per cent as of November 2020. In the Nifty 50 index, the weightage for these sectors is only around 15 percent. This helped Nifty Next 50 index outperform the Nifty 50 in most of the secular bull-run years between 2014 and 2017. However, the cyclical heavy Nifty 50 (around 52 percent) helped it to deliver higher return than Nifty Next 50 in the polarized markets seen in 2018 and 2019. As far as the sectoral compositions are concerned, they complement to each other. Hence, both Nifty 50 and Nifty Next 50 funds can be part of one's portfolio.  Incubator of Nifty 50 ‘The Nifty Next 50 is an incubator for the Nifty 50. Whenever new companies enter into Nifty 50 basket, they are selected from the Nifty Next 50” says Vishal Jain - Head - ETF - Nippon India Mutual Fund. DSP’s Ghelani adds that in the last 20 years, 44 stocks have moved from Nifty Next 50 to Nifty 50. Which is also why Nifty Next 50 is typically referred as a set of ‘tomorrow’s bluechip companies.’ Nifty 100 versus a combination of Nifty 50 and Nifty Next 50 Although the Nifty 100 index consists of all stocks that are in the two indices – Nifty 50 and Nifty Next 50 – it’s not as simple as it looks. Around 87 percent of Nifty 100 lies in Nifty 50 stocks, and just 13 percent lies in the Nifty Next 50 constituents, as of November 2020. “While optically one might think that it would be better to have only one (Nifty 100) rather than owning two funds, but practically, the risk and return expectations would be very different,” says Ghelani who advices a mix of Nifty 50 and Nifty Next 50 indices.

On the higher side, if Nifty has to regain strength, it needs to surpass 13550 – 13600 with participation of few marquee heavyweights, especially from the banking space.For the coming session, the intermediate supports are placed at 13396 – 13342 – 13266.

Despite the market hitting new record highs in the last couple of weeks, we have been repeatedly advocating booking profits and staying light. With yesterday’s sharp fall, we can see the last twelve day’s gains going for a toss.For the coming session, any bounce back towards 13450 – 13550 is likely to get sold into, whereas on the lower side, Nifty has reached its first level of retracement i.e. the ’89-EMA’ level (13100) on the ‘180-minutes’ chart. Ideally, the next level of the natural profit booking is around 12800, which is the ‘200-SMA’ level on the same time frame chart. But before this, yesterday’s low of 13130, would be seen as immediate support for the index.Traders are continuously advised to stay light and avoid taking contradictory bets in the coming session. With a larger view, this correction should be interpreted as a healthy sign and it will certainly provide better opportunities to enter marquee names on correction. But for momentum traders, the way chart structure seems distorted, it has certainly dented the recent optimism.  Monday's correction finally validated our recent cautious stance.

Invest Now The trend on the Street became completely negative afterÂ scientists in the United KingdomÂ discovered a new strain of COVID-19 leading to several nations restricting flight services to Britain. India joined a growing list of countries that have already announced restrictions on travel to the UK. These countries include Ireland, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium. The benchmark indices witnessed the biggest single day fall since May 4, 2020. The BSE Sensex plunged 1,406.73 points, or 3 percent, to 45,553.96, while the Nifty50 fell 432.10 points, or 3.14 percent, to 13,328.40 and formed big bearish candle on the daily charts. Follow our coronavirus live blog here for latest updates In May this year, Sensex was down little more than 2,000 points. In fact, majority of biggest single falls were seen in 2020 itself due to COVID-19 pandemic. On an intraday basis on December 21, Sensex was down 2,037 points. More than Rs 6.6 lakh crore of investors' wealthÂ was eroded in a single day today. It was a bad start to the week. European markets like France's CAC, Germany's DAX and Britain's FTSE were also down 2-3 percent each, while Dow Jones futures declined nearly 2 percent, at 15:30 hours IST, pointing sharp decline in the US opening trade. ""The new variant of the Novel Coronavirus in the UK spooked markets as we witnessed intense selling in pivotal throughout afternoon trade. While the Street was bracing for a correction this week after a sharp up move, the sheer velocity of the fall across broader markets took the bulls by surprise as practically none of the key index constituents were in the green today,"" S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP Securities told Moneycontrol. A new variant of the novel coronavirus has been identified in the United Kingdom. England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said on December 19 that the new variant of the coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, can spread faster. Scientists are working to confirm if the mutation leads to a higher mortality rate or cause more severe illnesses. As per media reports, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is scheduled to chair a crisis meeting on Monday as a growing number of countries blocked flights from Britain over a new highly infectious coronavirus strain, the UK said was ""out of control"". Selling was seen across the board as not a single stock in BSE Sensex and Nifty50 closed in the green.  ONGC was the biggest loser among Sensex stocks, falling over 9 percent due to more than 5 percent correction in oil prices which were trying to stabilise above $50 a barrel recently due to likely increase in oil demand. Tata Motors also fell more than 9 percent following strict lockdown measures in the United Kingdom where Jaguar Land Rover operates. IndusInd Bank, M&M, SBI, NTPC, ITC, Axis Bank, Power Grid, ICICI Bank, Sun Pharma, Bharti Airtel and Bajaj Finance were down 4-7 percent each. The BSE FMCG, Healthcare, Auto, Bank, Capital Goods, Metal, Oil & Gas and Power were down 3-6 percent each, while IT was down 1.7 percent. The broader markets corrected more than the benchmarks as the BSE Midcap index was down 4.14 percent and Smallcap fell 4.57 percent. But analysts do not expect major correction in the near term and advised buying quality stocks on dips. ""As we all know, the vulnerability of the market was high due to quick gains made in the ongoing rally leading to low margin of safety. Despite which, we do not expect a big correction rather a consolidation, in the short-term, of not more than 7-10 percent in the main indices. Buying at dips can be considered as a strategy in the falling market,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial services told Moneycontrol. ""Even so, the strain appears similar to the current one for which vaccine rollout is on at full speed. Therefore, the bad news seems to come with its own glimmer of hope. Nothing else has majorly changed. We continued to buy today, and will do so for the rest of the week. Today's markets are therefore a could serve as an entry point for those waiting for a correction,"" Kanika Agarrwal, Co-founder and Chief Investment Officer at Upside AI said.

Invest Now  Taking Stock | Stocks Fall Like Ninepins As Volatility Index Jumps 25%; Investors Lose Rs 6.64 Lakh Crore Nifty formed a big red candlestick formation on the daily chart, erasing the gains of the last 11 days.... Read More Today, the market has formed big red candlestick formation on a daily chart. It has erased the gains of last 11 days. In fact, since the market has formed higher bottom at 12790 on 26th of November, the market has never given any decisive candlestick pattern on daily basis. Even though the trend of upward and gained 1000 points in 15 days Nifty made multiple indecisive candles in between. The same indecisiveness finally resulted into today’s vertical fall. It’s a bearish reversal formation the short term. Nifty could slide to either 13000 levels, where it has support as per Options data or 12500, which was the highest of the previous up-move (all time highest levels on Nifty till January 2020). On the higher side, 13400/13500 would be hurdle zone. Reduce weak long positions between 13400/13500 levels. Only strong markets can cross and close above 13500 levels. Strong buying opportunity between 12700/12600 levels for medium term investors.  Markets plunged sharply lower and lost over 3%, tracking unsupportive global cues. After the initial downtick, the benchmark recouped all the losses but couldn’t sustain at the higher levels as the day progressed. However, the situation worsened with the weak start of the European markets, in reaction to the news of strict lockdown in the UK. Consequently, the Nifty ended deep in the red at 13,328 levels. All sectoral and broader market indices too ended with the negative bias wherein metals, oil & gas and realty were the top losers. We’ve been maintaining a cautious on markets and reiterate the same for the following sessions too. The recent spurt of COVID cases in the UK has spooked the markets world over as the new variant could increase the transmission rate. Now, the next step is strict travel restrictions, which would dent the economic recovery. Technically, Nifty has tested the lower band of the prevailing rising broadening formation around 13,150 and its breakdown could trigger a further decline towards the 12,700-12,800 zone. In case of a rebound, the 13,400-13,600 zone would act as a hurdle. We suggest avoiding naked leveraged trade in the futures segment and preferring option strategies until the markets stabilise. Investors, on the other hand, should utilise this fall and accumulate quality stocks on dips. In fear of a new wave of coronavirus and reports of the rapid spreading of new virus strain in the UK, a deep correction was triggered in the equity market. Travel restrictions imposed by several countries to and from UK have added concerns of yet another lockdown. European market witnessed further selling pressure, as the UK and EU failed to reach a trade deal before the decided deadline. As we all know, the vulnerability of the market was high due to quick gains made in the ongoing rally leading to low margin of safety. Despite which, we do not expect a big correction rather a consolidation, in the short-term, of not more than 7 % to 10% in the main indices. Buying at dips can be considered as a strategy in the falling market.    The Indian equities tumbled as new strain of coronavirus in the UK created panic among the investors. Also the overhang on Brexit talks has added to negative sentiments. Further lack of depth in the market owing to holiday season aided to the big fall today. We expect equities market to witness further volatility in the near term. Nevertheless, correction after big rally is always a healthy sign for the market and provide good opportunity to add quality stocks for investment purpose.   We continue to remain positive on equities for next 2-3 years owing to weakness in USD coupled with pro-growth government policies and dovish fiscal policies. On the global front, we got good news and bad news overnight – Good being that the democrats and republicans managed to finalize the latest stimulus package which will add $900bn to the US economy. The bad news is a new strain of the virus in the UK which appears to be more contagious than the existing one. Even so, the strain appears similar to the current one for which vaccine rollout is on at full speed. Therefore, the bad news seems to come with its own glimmer of hope. Nothing else has majorly changed. We continued to buy today, and will do so for the rest of the week. Today’s markets are therefore could serve as an entry point for those waiting for a correction. As Warren Buffett says, “be greedy when others are fearful.” The new variant of the Novel Coronavirus in the UK spooked markets as we witnessed intense selling in pivotal throughout afternoon trade. While the street was bracing for a correction this week after a sharp up move, the sheer velocity of the fall across broader markets took the bulls by surprise as practically none of the key indices constituents were in the Green today. The Index has broken its support of 13500 which indicates a stop out on all long positions. We would now need to wait and watch the markets over the next couple of sessions. One should not take hasty and risky trades by going long or short on the markets. For the upside to resume, we would need to start trading above 13750-13800. In order to break on the downside, we should wait for a day or two and re-evaluate the markets. The strategy for the current market would be to sit on the sideline without a trade! Indian rupeeended21 paise lower at 73.78 per dollar, amidhuge sellingseen in the domestic equity market.It opened 18 paise lower at 73.75 per dollar against Friday's close of 73.57 and remained in the range of 73.64-73.82.  Market broke the six day winning streak as it witnessed freefall in the second half dragging Nifty below 13,350 on the back of fear of a new wave of coronavirus in the UK. At close, the Sensex was down 1,406.73 points or 3.00% at 45553.96, and the Nifty was down 432.10 points or 3.14% at 13328.40. About 580 shares have advanced, 2381 shares declined, and 163 shares are unchanged. All stocks on the Nifty50 ended lower led by the ONGC, Tata Motors, GAIL, Hindalco and IOC. All the sectoral indices ended in the red. Nifty PSU Bank index shed 7 percent, while Metal, Infra, Bank, Auto and Energy indices fell 4-5 percent. The market failed to show resilience to stay above the Nifty 50 Index level of 13750. While it is subject to further price action evolution, the technical factors are shifted after the sharp correction today to support a further correction in the future. Any corrective wave down should find support around 12990-12960. As such, we advise the traders to refrain from building a new buying position until we witness a correction till 12990-12960 level. It has observed volatility to expand in today’s trading session indicating profit booking and stock distribution at a higher market level.

On the higher side, if Nifty has to regain strength, it needs to surpass 13550 – 13600 with participation of few marquee heavyweights, especially from the banking space.For the coming session, the intermediate supports are placed at 13396 – 13342 – 13266. Since the last few days we have been a bit cautious and we continue to remain so; but traders can now opt to stay stock specific, where we are likely to see trading opportunities on both sides. As far as sectors are concerned, IT stocks continue to attract buying interest and they are expected to do well in the coming session as well. Apart from this, few stocks from the ‘Oil And Gas’ universe have reached their support and are likely to see some bounce back moves.

Until that level is not threatened we continue to remain in bullish territory. If that level breaks, we could slide down to 12800. On the upside, we need to get past the hurdles of 13700-13800 to start forming an opinion to go long again. Hence, a wait and watch approach would be a prudent way to deal with the current markets. 13100-13150 is a good support for the Nifty and we are trading well above that this morning.

(Read here) Monday's correction finally validated our recent cautious stance. Despite the market hitting new record highs in the last couple of weeks, we have been repeatedly advocating booking profits and staying light. With yesterday’s sharp fall, we can see the last twelve day’s gains going for a toss.For the coming session, any bounce back towards 13450 – 13550 is likely to get sold into, whereas on the lower side, Nifty has reached its first level of retracement i.e. the ’89-EMA’ level (13100) on the ‘180-minutes’ chart. Ideally, the next level of the natural profit booking is around 12800, which is the ‘200-SMA’ level on the same time frame chart. But before this, yesterday’s low of 13130, would be seen as immediate support for the index.Traders are continuously advised to stay light and avoid taking contradictory bets in the coming session. With a larger view, this correction should be interpreted as a healthy sign and it will certainly provide better opportunities to enter marquee names on correction. But for momentum traders, the way chart structure seems distorted, it has certainly dented the recent optimism.  Monday's correction finally validated our recent cautious stance.

Invest Now The trend on the Street became completely negative afterÂ scientists in the United KingdomÂ discovered a new strain of COVID-19 leading to several nations restricting flight services to Britain. India joined a growing list of countries that have already announced restrictions on travel to the UK. These countries include Ireland, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium. The benchmark indices witnessed the biggest single day fall since May 4, 2020. The BSE Sensex plunged 1,406.73 points, or 3 percent, to 45,553.96, while the Nifty50 fell 432.10 points, or 3.14 percent, to 13,328.40 and formed big bearish candle on the daily charts. Follow our coronavirus live blog here for latest updates In May this year, Sensex was down little more than 2,000 points. In fact, majority of biggest single falls were seen in 2020 itself due to COVID-19 pandemic. On an intraday basis on December 21, Sensex was down 2,037 points. More than Rs 6.6 lakh crore of investors' wealthÂ was eroded in a single day today. It was a bad start to the week. European markets like France's CAC, Germany's DAX and Britain's FTSE were also down 2-3 percent each, while Dow Jones futures declined nearly 2 percent, at 15:30 hours IST, pointing sharp decline in the US opening trade. ""The new variant of the Novel Coronavirus in the UK spooked markets as we witnessed intense selling in pivotal throughout afternoon trade. While the Street was bracing for a correction this week after a sharp up move, the sheer velocity of the fall across broader markets took the bulls by surprise as practically none of the key index constituents were in the green today,"" S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP Securities told Moneycontrol. A new variant of the novel coronavirus has been identified in the United Kingdom. England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said on December 19 that the new variant of the coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, can spread faster. Scientists are working to confirm if the mutation leads to a higher mortality rate or cause more severe illnesses. As per media reports, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is scheduled to chair a crisis meeting on Monday as a growing number of countries blocked flights from Britain over a new highly infectious coronavirus strain, the UK said was ""out of control"". Selling was seen across the board as not a single stock in BSE Sensex and Nifty50 closed in the green.  ONGC was the biggest loser among Sensex stocks, falling over 9 percent due to more than 5 percent correction in oil prices which were trying to stabilise above $50 a barrel recently due to likely increase in oil demand. Tata Motors also fell more than 9 percent following strict lockdown measures in the United Kingdom where Jaguar Land Rover operates. IndusInd Bank, M&M, SBI, NTPC, ITC, Axis Bank, Power Grid, ICICI Bank, Sun Pharma, Bharti Airtel and Bajaj Finance were down 4-7 percent each. The BSE FMCG, Healthcare, Auto, Bank, Capital Goods, Metal, Oil & Gas and Power were down 3-6 percent each, while IT was down 1.7 percent. The broader markets corrected more than the benchmarks as the BSE Midcap index was down 4.14 percent and Smallcap fell 4.57 percent. But analysts do not expect major correction in the near term and advised buying quality stocks on dips. ""As we all know, the vulnerability of the market was high due to quick gains made in the ongoing rally leading to low margin of safety. Despite which, we do not expect a big correction rather a consolidation, in the short-term, of not more than 7-10 percent in the main indices. Buying at dips can be considered as a strategy in the falling market,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial services told Moneycontrol. ""Even so, the strain appears similar to the current one for which vaccine rollout is on at full speed. Therefore, the bad news seems to come with its own glimmer of hope. Nothing else has majorly changed. We continued to buy today, and will do so for the rest of the week. Today's markets are therefore a could serve as an entry point for those waiting for a correction,"" Kanika Agarrwal, Co-founder and Chief Investment Officer at Upside AI said.

Invest Now  Taking Stock | Stocks Fall Like Ninepins As Volatility Index Jumps 25%; Investors Lose Rs 6.64 Lakh Crore Nifty formed a big red candlestick formation on the daily chart, erasing the gains of the last 11 days.... Read More Today, the market has formed big red candlestick formation on a daily chart. It has erased the gains of last 11 days. In fact, since the market has formed higher bottom at 12790 on 26th of November, the market has never given any decisive candlestick pattern on daily basis. Even though the trend of upward and gained 1000 points in 15 days Nifty made multiple indecisive candles in between. The same indecisiveness finally resulted into today’s vertical fall. It’s a bearish reversal formation the short term. Nifty could slide to either 13000 levels, where it has support as per Options data or 12500, which was the highest of the previous up-move (all time highest levels on Nifty till January 2020). On the higher side, 13400/13500 would be hurdle zone. Reduce weak long positions between 13400/13500 levels. Only strong markets can cross and close above 13500 levels. Strong buying opportunity between 12700/12600 levels for medium term investors.  Markets plunged sharply lower and lost over 3%, tracking unsupportive global cues. After the initial downtick, the benchmark recouped all the losses but couldn’t sustain at the higher levels as the day progressed. However, the situation worsened with the weak start of the European markets, in reaction to the news of strict lockdown in the UK. Consequently, the Nifty ended deep in the red at 13,328 levels. All sectoral and broader market indices too ended with the negative bias wherein metals, oil & gas and realty were the top losers. We’ve been maintaining a cautious on markets and reiterate the same for the following sessions too. The recent spurt of COVID cases in the UK has spooked the markets world over as the new variant could increase the transmission rate. Now, the next step is strict travel restrictions, which would dent the economic recovery. Technically, Nifty has tested the lower band of the prevailing rising broadening formation around 13,150 and its breakdown could trigger a further decline towards the 12,700-12,800 zone. In case of a rebound, the 13,400-13,600 zone would act as a hurdle. We suggest avoiding naked leveraged trade in the futures segment and preferring option strategies until the markets stabilise. Investors, on the other hand, should utilise this fall and accumulate quality stocks on dips. In fear of a new wave of coronavirus and reports of the rapid spreading of new virus strain in the UK, a deep correction was triggered in the equity market. Travel restrictions imposed by several countries to and from UK have added concerns of yet another lockdown. European market witnessed further selling pressure, as the UK and EU failed to reach a trade deal before the decided deadline. As we all know, the vulnerability of the market was high due to quick gains made in the ongoing rally leading to low margin of safety. Despite which, we do not expect a big correction rather a consolidation, in the short-term, of not more than 7 % to 10% in the main indices. Buying at dips can be considered as a strategy in the falling market.    The Indian equities tumbled as new strain of coronavirus in the UK created panic among the investors. Also the overhang on Brexit talks has added to negative sentiments. Further lack of depth in the market owing to holiday season aided to the big fall today. We expect equities market to witness further volatility in the near term. Nevertheless, correction after big rally is always a healthy sign for the market and provide good opportunity to add quality stocks for investment purpose.   We continue to remain positive on equities for next 2-3 years owing to weakness in USD coupled with pro-growth government policies and dovish fiscal policies. On the global front, we got good news and bad news overnight – Good being that the democrats and republicans managed to finalize the latest stimulus package which will add $900bn to the US economy. The bad news is a new strain of the virus in the UK which appears to be more contagious than the existing one. Even so, the strain appears similar to the current one for which vaccine rollout is on at full speed. Therefore, the bad news seems to come with its own glimmer of hope. Nothing else has majorly changed. We continued to buy today, and will do so for the rest of the week. Today’s markets are therefore could serve as an entry point for those waiting for a correction. As Warren Buffett says, “be greedy when others are fearful.” The new variant of the Novel Coronavirus in the UK spooked markets as we witnessed intense selling in pivotal throughout afternoon trade. While the street was bracing for a correction this week after a sharp up move, the sheer velocity of the fall across broader markets took the bulls by surprise as practically none of the key indices constituents were in the Green today. The Index has broken its support of 13500 which indicates a stop out on all long positions. We would now need to wait and watch the markets over the next couple of sessions. One should not take hasty and risky trades by going long or short on the markets. For the upside to resume, we would need to start trading above 13750-13800. In order to break on the downside, we should wait for a day or two and re-evaluate the markets. The strategy for the current market would be to sit on the sideline without a trade! Indian rupeeended21 paise lower at 73.78 per dollar, amidhuge sellingseen in the domestic equity market.It opened 18 paise lower at 73.75 per dollar against Friday's close of 73.57 and remained in the range of 73.64-73.82.  Market broke the six day winning streak as it witnessed freefall in the second half dragging Nifty below 13,350 on the back of fear of a new wave of coronavirus in the UK. At close, the Sensex was down 1,406.73 points or 3.00% at 45553.96, and the Nifty was down 432.10 points or 3.14% at 13328.40. About 580 shares have advanced, 2381 shares declined, and 163 shares are unchanged. All stocks on the Nifty50 ended lower led by the ONGC, Tata Motors, GAIL, Hindalco and IOC. All the sectoral indices ended in the red. Nifty PSU Bank index shed 7 percent, while Metal, Infra, Bank, Auto and Energy indices fell 4-5 percent. The market failed to show resilience to stay above the Nifty 50 Index level of 13750. While it is subject to further price action evolution, the technical factors are shifted after the sharp correction today to support a further correction in the future. Any corrective wave down should find support around 12990-12960. As such, we advise the traders to refrain from building a new buying position until we witness a correction till 12990-12960 level. It has observed volatility to expand in today’s trading session indicating profit booking and stock distribution at a higher market level.

In our sense, for the next couple of days at least, the index is likely to remain in a slightly wider range before deciding its next path. The ideal range would be 13600 to 13100, where the lower range should be seen as a sacrosanct support, which is the ’89-EMA’ level on ‘180-minutes’ chart. On the higher side, if Nifty has to regain strength, it needs to surpass 13550 – 13600 with participation of few marquee heavyweights, especially from the banking space.For the coming session, the intermediate supports are placed at 13396 – 13342 – 13266.

(Read here) Monday's correction finally validated our recent cautious stance. Despite the market hitting new record highs in the last couple of weeks, we have been repeatedly advocating booking profits and staying light. With yesterday’s sharp fall, we can see the last twelve day’s gains going for a toss.For the coming session, any bounce back towards 13450 – 13550 is likely to get sold into, whereas on the lower side, Nifty has reached its first level of retracement i.e. the ’89-EMA’ level (13100) on the ‘180-minutes’ chart. Ideally, the next level of the natural profit booking is around 12800, which is the ‘200-SMA’ level on the same time frame chart. But before this, yesterday’s low of 13130, would be seen as immediate support for the index.Traders are continuously advised to stay light and avoid taking contradictory bets in the coming session. With a larger view, this correction should be interpreted as a healthy sign and it will certainly provide better opportunities to enter marquee names on correction. But for momentum traders, the way chart structure seems distorted, it has certainly dented the recent optimism.  Monday's correction finally validated our recent cautious stance.

""The new variant of the Novel Coronavirus in the UK spooked markets as we witnessed intense selling in pivotal throughout afternoon trade. While the Street was bracing for a correction this week after a sharp up move, the sheer velocity of the fall across broader markets took the bulls by surprise as practically none of the key index constituents were in the green today,"" S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP Securities told Moneycontrol. A new variant of the novel coronavirus has been identified in the United Kingdom. England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said on December 19 that the new variant of the coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, can spread faster. Scientists are working to confirm if the mutation leads to a higher mortality rate or cause more severe illnesses. As per media reports, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is scheduled to chair a crisis meeting on Monday as a growing number of countries blocked flights from Britain over a new highly infectious coronavirus strain, the UK said was ""out of control"". Selling was seen across the board as not a single stock in BSE Sensex and Nifty50 closed in the green.  ONGC was the biggest loser among Sensex stocks, falling over 9 percent due to more than 5 percent correction in oil prices which were trying to stabilise above $50 a barrel recently due to likely increase in oil demand. Tata Motors also fell more than 9 percent following strict lockdown measures in the United Kingdom where Jaguar Land Rover operates. IndusInd Bank, M&M, SBI, NTPC, ITC, Axis Bank, Power Grid, ICICI Bank, Sun Pharma, Bharti Airtel and Bajaj Finance were down 4-7 percent each. The BSE FMCG, Healthcare, Auto, Bank, Capital Goods, Metal, Oil & Gas and Power were down 3-6 percent each, while IT was down 1.7 percent. The broader markets corrected more than the benchmarks as the BSE Midcap index was down 4.14 percent and Smallcap fell 4.57 percent. But analysts do not expect major correction in the near term and advised buying quality stocks on dips. ""As we all know, the vulnerability of the market was high due to quick gains made in the ongoing rally leading to low margin of safety. Despite which, we do not expect a big correction rather a consolidation, in the short-term, of not more than 7-10 percent in the main indices. Buying at dips can be considered as a strategy in the falling market,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial services told Moneycontrol. ""Even so, the strain appears similar to the current one for which vaccine rollout is on at full speed. Therefore, the bad news seems to come with its own glimmer of hope. Nothing else has majorly changed. We continued to buy today, and will do so for the rest of the week. Today's markets are therefore a could serve as an entry point for those waiting for a correction,"" Kanika Agarrwal, Co-founder and Chief Investment Officer at Upside AI said.

Invest Now  Taking Stock | Stocks Fall Like Ninepins As Volatility Index Jumps 25%; Investors Lose Rs 6.64 Lakh Crore Nifty formed a big red candlestick formation on the daily chart, erasing the gains of the last 11 days.... Read More Today, the market has formed big red candlestick formation on a daily chart. It has erased the gains of last 11 days. In fact, since the market has formed higher bottom at 12790 on 26th of November, the market has never given any decisive candlestick pattern on daily basis. Even though the trend of upward and gained 1000 points in 15 days Nifty made multiple indecisive candles in between. The same indecisiveness finally resulted into today’s vertical fall. It’s a bearish reversal formation the short term. Nifty could slide to either 13000 levels, where it has support as per Options data or 12500, which was the highest of the previous up-move (all time highest levels on Nifty till January 2020). On the higher side, 13400/13500 would be hurdle zone. Reduce weak long positions between 13400/13500 levels. Only strong markets can cross and close above 13500 levels. Strong buying opportunity between 12700/12600 levels for medium term investors.  Markets plunged sharply lower and lost over 3%, tracking unsupportive global cues. After the initial downtick, the benchmark recouped all the losses but couldn’t sustain at the higher levels as the day progressed. However, the situation worsened with the weak start of the European markets, in reaction to the news of strict lockdown in the UK. Consequently, the Nifty ended deep in the red at 13,328 levels. All sectoral and broader market indices too ended with the negative bias wherein metals, oil & gas and realty were the top losers. We’ve been maintaining a cautious on markets and reiterate the same for the following sessions too. The recent spurt of COVID cases in the UK has spooked the markets world over as the new variant could increase the transmission rate. Now, the next step is strict travel restrictions, which would dent the economic recovery. Technically, Nifty has tested the lower band of the prevailing rising broadening formation around 13,150 and its breakdown could trigger a further decline towards the 12,700-12,800 zone. In case of a rebound, the 13,400-13,600 zone would act as a hurdle. We suggest avoiding naked leveraged trade in the futures segment and preferring option strategies until the markets stabilise. Investors, on the other hand, should utilise this fall and accumulate quality stocks on dips. In fear of a new wave of coronavirus and reports of the rapid spreading of new virus strain in the UK, a deep correction was triggered in the equity market. Travel restrictions imposed by several countries to and from UK have added concerns of yet another lockdown. European market witnessed further selling pressure, as the UK and EU failed to reach a trade deal before the decided deadline. As we all know, the vulnerability of the market was high due to quick gains made in the ongoing rally leading to low margin of safety. Despite which, we do not expect a big correction rather a consolidation, in the short-term, of not more than 7 % to 10% in the main indices. Buying at dips can be considered as a strategy in the falling market.    The Indian equities tumbled as new strain of coronavirus in the UK created panic among the investors. Also the overhang on Brexit talks has added to negative sentiments. Further lack of depth in the market owing to holiday season aided to the big fall today. We expect equities market to witness further volatility in the near term. Nevertheless, correction after big rally is always a healthy sign for the market and provide good opportunity to add quality stocks for investment purpose.   We continue to remain positive on equities for next 2-3 years owing to weakness in USD coupled with pro-growth government policies and dovish fiscal policies. On the global front, we got good news and bad news overnight – Good being that the democrats and republicans managed to finalize the latest stimulus package which will add $900bn to the US economy. The bad news is a new strain of the virus in the UK which appears to be more contagious than the existing one. Even so, the strain appears similar to the current one for which vaccine rollout is on at full speed. Therefore, the bad news seems to come with its own glimmer of hope. Nothing else has majorly changed. We continued to buy today, and will do so for the rest of the week. Today’s markets are therefore could serve as an entry point for those waiting for a correction. As Warren Buffett says, “be greedy when others are fearful.” The new variant of the Novel Coronavirus in the UK spooked markets as we witnessed intense selling in pivotal throughout afternoon trade. While the street was bracing for a correction this week after a sharp up move, the sheer velocity of the fall across broader markets took the bulls by surprise as practically none of the key indices constituents were in the Green today. The Index has broken its support of 13500 which indicates a stop out on all long positions. We would now need to wait and watch the markets over the next couple of sessions. One should not take hasty and risky trades by going long or short on the markets. For the upside to resume, we would need to start trading above 13750-13800. In order to break on the downside, we should wait for a day or two and re-evaluate the markets. The strategy for the current market would be to sit on the sideline without a trade! Indian rupeeended21 paise lower at 73.78 per dollar, amidhuge sellingseen in the domestic equity market.It opened 18 paise lower at 73.75 per dollar against Friday's close of 73.57 and remained in the range of 73.64-73.82.  Market broke the six day winning streak as it witnessed freefall in the second half dragging Nifty below 13,350 on the back of fear of a new wave of coronavirus in the UK. At close, the Sensex was down 1,406.73 points or 3.00% at 45553.96, and the Nifty was down 432.10 points or 3.14% at 13328.40. About 580 shares have advanced, 2381 shares declined, and 163 shares are unchanged. All stocks on the Nifty50 ended lower led by the ONGC, Tata Motors, GAIL, Hindalco and IOC. All the sectoral indices ended in the red. Nifty PSU Bank index shed 7 percent, while Metal, Infra, Bank, Auto and Energy indices fell 4-5 percent. The market failed to show resilience to stay above the Nifty 50 Index level of 13750. While it is subject to further price action evolution, the technical factors are shifted after the sharp correction today to support a further correction in the future. Any corrective wave down should find support around 12990-12960. As such, we advise the traders to refrain from building a new buying position until we witness a correction till 12990-12960 level. It has observed volatility to expand in today’s trading session indicating profit booking and stock distribution at a higher market level.

However, the high inflation leaves little margin for any further rate cuts and as the Vaccine for the coronavirus pandemic comes in and the economy recovers, RBI will have no choice but to start increasing the interest rates,"" said Aditya Shah, CFA, and CIO of JST Investments.

In this article, we review the performance of this index. Since the index is new, the entire historical data  (from 1st April 2005) is based on a backtest). The index is essentially a mixture of three indices: 50% of Nifty 100 plus 25% of Nifty Midcap 150 and 25% of Nifty Smallcap 250 TRI. The 500 stocks of Nifty500 Multicap 50:25:25 Index would be identical to Nifty 500, but the weights would be considerably different. For example, according to the Dec 2020 Factsheet (based on Nov-end data) the top-ten stocks of Nifty500 Multicap 50:25:25 Index are given below. The percentages within brackets (red) denote the corresponding weightage in Nifty 500. It is clear that the concentration risk is considerably lower in this weighted index. We shall now proceed to compare the index movement with other prominent benchmarks. The multicap index movement is quite close to that of NIfty Next 50 TRI (when viewed from 1st April 2005) and has pulled away from the Nifty 50 TRI only during the 2013-2017 bull run. These are indices that make up the multicap index. Rolling returns of the multicap index (yellow); Nifty 100 TRI (white) and Nifty 50 TRI (brown) are shown below for five and ten years. This just means we look at every possible 5Y and 10Y returns bet 1st April 2005 and Dec 3rrd 2020. The number of such data points in each coloured line is indicated within each image. Over 10 years, the likelihood of the multicap index outperforming Nifty 50 and Nifty 100 is higher; over five years it is pretty much a coin-toss. If we repeat the exercise with Nifty Next 50, Nifty Midcap 150 and Nifty Smallcap 250, we see that there is not much of a difference bet the multicap index and Nifty Next 50. Once again the futility of investing in a small cap index is seen above. Also see: Nippon India Nifty Smallcap 250 Index Fund: Can I add this to my passive portfolio? Next, we compare the five and ten tear rolling risk or standard deviation of the multicap index with Nifty 50 and Nifty Next 50. The volatility of the hybrid index is similar to Nifty 50 TRI  In summary, the new Nifty500 Multicap 50:25:25 Index has a risk profile close to Nifty 50 and a reward profile close to Nifty Next 50. Passive fans should not expect an index fund tracking this. This was meant for the new type of multicap funds to benchmark themselves.

Anil Singhvi remains bullish, lays down growth trajectory | Zee Business","Will Bank Nifty touch the 30,000 mark on Wednesday? Notably, Dow Jones hit this mark in yesterday's trading. How is it poised today? Zee Business Managing Editor Anil Singhvi gives a bullish take on the mood and momentum of this index.  The Market Guru began his comment on a lighter note saying that if the Markets were opened at night, Bank Nifty would have touched the mark first!  Watch Zee Business Tweet Video Below: आज बैंक निफ्टी भी 30,000 के पार ! अनिल सिंघवी- निफ्टी की तरह बैंक निफ्टी में भी जारी रहेगा एक्शन, बनेगी और तेजी… 30500-30600 पार हुआ, तो बढ़ेगा लाईफटाइम हाई की ओर#EditorsTake #BankNifty #Nifty #StockMarket @AnilSinghvi_ pic.twitter.com/KsZjnV0cf9 — Zee Business (@ZeeBusiness) November 25, 2020 On a serious note, Singhvi said that it will be interesting to see if today the Bank Nifty ends above the levels where Dow ended on Tuesday.   Dow had ended at 30,046 on Tuesday. The US Markets will be closed on Thursday and will trade for the first half session on Friday.  The Managing Editor said that the Bank Nifty strengthened its position on Tuesday though it is still at some distance from its lifetime high of 32,600. There are good possibilities that it will head towards its lifetime high levels.   Meanwhile, Nifty is way above its previous lifetime high of 12,430. It has a good 8-9 per cent lead. The question is if Nifty has already done this, why should Bank Nifty trade 8-9 per cent down from its lifetime high?   He expected great momentum and action to remain in the Bank Nifty. It is another thing that at times of market corrections, banking stocks take the lead, Singhvi said. Bank Nifty rises and falls more at times than Nifty's fall and rise.   It appears now that the Bank Nifty will take an upward move from here. Taking a strong stand, the Market Guru said that his first target was 30,250-30,450. It should achieve these levels by today or tomorrow (the day of expiry).  If Bank Nifty crosses this level, the next target is between 30,650 and 30,850.  Singhvi said that if the Bank Nifty settles above 30,500-30,600, it is likely that it will move towards its lifetime high levels.

The 50-stock index is currently trading at a one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple of 26.6 times, according to Bloomberg data. That compares with its 10-year average of 17.3 times. The Nifty 50 is also trading two standard deviations above its historical average. India’s benchmarks tracked their global peers in the worst selloff in more than a decade, tumbling 40% from the peak in January to their March-low, after the nation imposed one of the world’s harshest lockdowns to contain the coronavirus. But they have since erased losses, riding on the optimism stemming from the fiscal and monetary stimulus announced by the government and central bank, a faster-than-expected pickup in economic activities after lockdown curbs were eased, robust foreign flows and a potential Covid-19 vaccine. The rally even prompted global financial services providers to raise their targets for Indian equities. Goldman Sachs upgraded India’s rating to ‘overweight’ and revised its target for Nifty to 14,100 by the end of 2021. Nomura expects the Nifty to touch 13,640 by December 2021. Morgan Stanley hiked its target for the Sensex to 50,000 by the end of next year, citing that “the coming growth cycle is not fully priced in”. “(A large) part of the market optimism is fuelled by a better-than-expected Q2 FY21, wherein maximum companies benefitted from low raw material costs and realised operating leverage benefits, with positive management commentary on demand prospects and retaining some part of operating leverage gains in the post Covid world,” said Pankaj Pandey, head (research) at ICICI Securities Ltd. According to Gautam Duggad, head of research at Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd., valuations are reflecting a recovery from the second half of FY21, leaving a limited margin for safety for any negative surprises. “Hence, we prefer companies with a higher visibility in terms of a demand recovery (higher rural exposure); a strong competitive positioning; margin drivers; and balance sheet strength.”  Here’s a look at how valuations of some of the stocks in the Nifty 50 fared:",nifty india 50 companies recovery

Invest Now Indian market closed in the green for the fifth consecutive day in a row on Tuesday following a positive trend seen in other Asian markets as well. Bulls managed to push both Sensex and Nifty50 to record highs but saw some profit booking at higher levels. The S&P BSE Sensex hit a fresh record high above 44,000 for the first time at 44,161 while the Nifty50 reclaimed 11,900 levels but failed to close above the same. Let’s look at the final tally on D-Street – the S&P BSE Sensex rose 314 points to 43,952 while the Nifty50 closed with gains of 93 points to 12,874. Sectorally, the action was seen in industrials, metals, capital goods, banks, and realty stocks. Experts are of the view that vaccine news has triggered risk-on sentiment. For bulls to remain in charge of D-Street, it is important for the Nifty50 to hold on to 12900 levels, suggest experts. COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. The Nifty has reached the long-term resistance of significant uptrend line (trend line connected the rising tops of the last two years-as per weekly/monthly chart). Presently, Nifty is making an attempt of breaking above this crucial overhead resistance at 12850 levels. “Any slowing down of upside momentum around this area could bring some profit booking from the highs and a decisive/ sustainable move could open the next upside target of 13500 levels,” Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told Moneycontrol. “The short term trend of Nifty continues to be positive. The market is now placed at the make or break area of 12850-12900 levels in the short term. Inability to generate further strength in the upside momentum could result in a minor weakness from the highs in the next 1-2 sessions,” he said. Shetti further added that a decisive move above this hurdle could open the next upside target of 13500 for the next couple of weeks. Here is what experts think that investors should do on November 18: Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. The Nifty had a gap up opening on November 17. Though it couldn't build upon the early gains it maintained the positive stance. The current leg of the rally which started from the beginning of November, achieved its equality target (12850) on the upside. Structurally, there is scope for an extension on the upside, which means the index can continue to stretch higher. Going ahead, 13000 & 13350 will be the key short term targets to watch out for. On the flip side, 12750-12700 will act as a near term support zone for Nifty. Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking Ltd The upbeat global markets combined with the news of successful vaccine trails is helping the benchmark to inch higher with every passing day. However, given the sharp up move recently, markets may see some consolidation however the bias would remain on the positive side. Further, with earnings season largely over, we expect global cues to dictate the market trend ahead. Amid all, the broader markets are attracting noticeable traction so traders should plan their positions accordingly. Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research at Kotak Securities Positive news on the Covid-19 vaccine sparked a rally in global markets resulting in a rub-off effect on domestic shares as well. Shares tied to the core economy logged gains, raising hopes of an economic reopening. Although the Nifty is trading at the stiff resistance level of 12900/13000, the momentum in the market is uninterrupted and that's the reason the stock-specific activity is picking up. Avoid taking long trades on the Nifty 50 Index. As per candlestick patterns, the Nifty has formed a ""Hanging Man"" formation at the highest point of the day. Till the market is not closing above the level of 12950, we could see stock-specific activity in the market. Ashis Biswas, Head of Technical Research, CapitalVia Global Research- Investment Advisor 12770 is going to be a key support level for the market for the next few trading sessions. Any break below this level we may expect a short-term correction till 12480. On the upside, as there is significant divergence in most of the oscillator like RSI, MACD we expect market participants will use any rally to book profit rather than building a fresh positions. Any significant rally from here is unlikely before we see some correction. 12930-12950 is likely to act as a supply zone.

The NSE Nifty 50 index and the S&P BSE Sensex ended about 0.2% higher at 12,719.95 and 43,443, respectively, on Friday.  Here's a look at the updates of the market action on BSE and NSE today  3. 56PM: Market outlook  Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking said,""The benchmark started the week on a buoyant note following global peers as positive developments on the vaccine front lifted sentiments globally. The Nifty index traded with positive bias throughout the session and ended higher by 0.7% at 12,874 levels. The broader markets outperformed wherein both Midcap and Smallcap ended higher by 1.1% and 0.9% respectively. On the sector front, Metal, Capital Goods, and Banking were the top gainers whereas IT, Healthcare and Oil & Gas ended with minor losses.  The upbeat global markets combined with the news of successful vaccine trails is helping the benchmark to inch higher with every passing day. However, given the sharp up move recently, markets may see some consolidation however the bias would remain on the positive side. Further, with earnings season largely over, we expect global cues to dictate the market trend ahead. Amid all, the broader markets are attracting noticeable traction so traders should plan their positions accordingly.""  3. 44PM: Closing  Market indices closed on a bullish note on Tuesday, amid positive global equities, as renewed hopes of COVID-19 vaccine kept invbestors optimistic. Sensex closed 314 points higher at 43,952, while Nifty gained by 93 points to end at 12,874 today.  3. 30 PM: Market outlook  Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial services said,""The market hit the all-time high, factoring yesterday's trading holiday, led by banking stocks and investors rejoicing  about the news of another vaccine to end the pandemic. This week, global markets started well, however today, it experienced mixed sentiments owing to increase in virus cases and tighter restrictions in the western world. Optimism over the development of vaccine is still outweighing concerns over the next wave of Covid. We recommend investors to start considering partial profit booking, on a short-term basis, due to high gaps developing between the actual performance of the economy and the market""  3. 14PM: Market outlook  On markets closing --Manish Hathiramani, proprietary index trader and technical analyst, Deen Dayal Investments said,""The Nifty took a bit of a breather post opening but clawed its way back to almost the high of the day. It is really a matter of time before we see the 13000 level on the index. While a strong support lies at 12550-12600, the overall trend is bullish and the momentum is fierce. A buy on dips approach would be the best way to enter into long positions.""  3.04 PM: YES Bank share hits gains for ninth straight session  YES Bank shares were trading higher for the ninth consecutive session on Tuesday, buoyed by a rally in broader benchmark indices. The stock has given 19.58% returns to its investors in the last 9 days.

EBITDA beats us / consensus by 37% / 34%. Vs. estimate - Volumes are exactly in-line. Realisations better by 5% and opex/tn lower by 3%. EBITDA/tn at Rs1,462 is 37% better. This is JK Cement's record performance since inception- highest ever absolute and per tonne profitability. We read JK Cement as one of those rare cement manufacturers which has been quite vocal about their public acknowledgement of existence of systemic Supply-Chain inefficiencies. Even on their call commentaries they have hinted multiple initiatives directly / indirectly on Supply-Chain front which has helped them to report such a 'Super Strong' set of numbers, as we see.""  1. 52PM: Market outlook  On markets today--Manish Hathiramani, proprietary index trader and technical analyst, Deen Dayal Investments said,""We are slowly inching towards the 13000 level. The next resistance for the index is 11950. If we can get past that, we could achieve 13100 during the course of the November series. The Nifty has a good support at 12550-12600 levels and till that holds, we can buy on all dips.""  1. 46 PM: Trade deficit outlook  Jyoti Roy - DVP- Equity Strategist, Angel Broking said,"" India's merchandise trade deficit for the month of October 2020 stood at USD 8.71bn as compared to USD 11.75bn in October 2019. Exports for October 2020 were down by 5.1% YoY to USD 24.89bn, while imports were down by 11.53% YoY to USD 33.61bn. The trade deficit has widened from September's USD 2.7bn sequential decline in exports. Oil imports were down by 38.5% YoY to USD 5.8bn while non oil imports were down by 2.24% YoY to USD 27.62bn.  The economic slowdown and sharp fall in fuel prices due to Covid-19 has led to compression of India merchandise trade deficit which coupled with strong FPI flows have led to a strengthening bias on the rupee. In order to counter an appreciating rupee the RBI has been intervening in the forex market which is reflected in India's foreign exchange reserves which has hit all time highs of USD 568.5bn as on the 6th of November. Going forward we expect overall BoP to remain in the surplus. In order to counter the appreciating bias we expect continued intervention by the RBI in the forex market as the Government and the RBI would not want the rupee to appreciate significantly from current levels.  1.34PM: Global markets today  Asian markets are trading mixed with a positive bias backed by renewed hopes on covid-19 vaccine development.  US markets closed higher on Monday after Moderna said that its vaccine against Covid-19 was 94.5% effective lifting expectation of a stronger economic recovery. European markets closed higher on Monday as hopes for Covid-19 vaccine were boosted after news from Moderna. Oil&Gas stocks gained.  1.20 PM: Vaccine development & US policy outlook  Centrum Broking said in its note,"" With the interplay of aforementioned positive domestic factors coupled with the positive global factors in the form of development of vaccine and elimination of US policy uncertainty with US elections out of the way, we recommend investors to increase weights in beta stocks, on the back of stronger economic recovery. Thus, we are shifting weight away from FMCG and pharma making them equivalent weights and shifting it to BFSI sector. We continue to maintain our overweight stance on IT as we believe that digitisation wave is more structural and cannot be reversed, as this has led to cost savings for most corporates.""  1. 11PM: Nifty technical outlook  Geojit Financial said in its report today,"" The 13400/700 view that we had discussed last week continue to be in play, but standard deviation studies suggest that a swing lower is highly overdue. This forces us to limit upside objectives to 12920/980 for now, while keeping a watchful eye on 12600-12400.""  12.49 PM: Market outlook  In its Technical & Derivatives Report, Sameet Chavan (Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives, Angel BrokingDuring the previous week, we had witnessed a 'Bullish Flag' breakout around 12050 and since then markets never looked back. With its marathon rally in merely eight days, markets are very much in a commanding position. All's well that ends well and hence, from hereon we can see a brighter picture till the next SAMVAT. Looking at the daily chart, we can observe a couple of encouraging developments on charts. The 'RSI-Smoothened' is moving northwards after entering the bullish territory above 70 and adding to this, the 'ADX (14)' is becoming stronger as we can see its value rising well above the 25 mark. Generally, when we see these conditions together, it provides impetus to the rally. Hence, any dip towards 12600 - 12450 should be used as a buying opportunity. On the upside, the next milestone of 13000 is likely to be achieved very soon; in fact, we do not rule out the possibility of reaching 13100 - 13200 in this week itself.""  12. 23PM: BPCL disinvestment oiutlook  Jyoti Roy - DVP- Equity Strategist, Angel Broking said,"" As per various media reports the government has received bids from several companies for buying the Government's 52.98% stake in Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL). The last date for submission of expression of interest (EoI) was on the 16th of November. The deadline had been extended multiple times by the Government due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. This marks the end of the first phase of BPCL divestment by the Government. As per process the Government will now scrutinize the EOIs post which qualifying bidders will be asked to submit their financial bids for BPCL. Successful closure of BPCL stake sale in the current financial year is very critical for the Government given the ballooning fiscal deficit which is expected to overshoot the budget estimate by a wide margin.""  12.10 PM: October WPI inflation outlook  Jyoti Roy - DVP- Equity Strategist, Angel Broking said,"" WPI inflation for the month of October 2020 increased to 1.48% from a revised figure of 1.32% in September. Primary article inflation slowed to 4.74% for the month as compared to 5.1% in September while fuel inflation continued to remain in the negative territory at -10.95%. However manufactured inflation which accounts for 64.2% of the WPI accelerated to 2.12% from 1.61% in September. However food inflation which accounts for 24.4% of the WPI softened to 5.78% from 6.92% in September. While the CPI inflation has accelerated significantly and is well above the RBI's comfort threshold of 6% WPI inflation continues to remain low though on an upwards trajectory. Going forward it is expected that manufacturing inflation will continue to move up gradually from a low base while food inflation will continue to dominate the headlines.""  11. 44AM: HDFC AMC outlook  Jaikishan Parmar - Sr. Equity Research Analyst, Angel Broking said,"" HDFC AMC appointed Navneet Munot as the Managing Director & CEO. He will succeed the present Managing Director Milind Barve.  Navneet Munot, who is currently chief investment officer at SBI Mutual Fund and he worked here for 12 years. For the last few quarters market share has been not growing for HDFC AMC, in HDFC AMC's AUM declined  3.2% YoY to Rs. 3,54,400 crore (flattish QoQ), primarily on account of decline in liquid AUM. Equity AUM declined 12.8% YoY to Rs. 1,43,700 crore. HDFC AMC witnessed a decline in market share from 14.9% in Q2FY20 to 13.2% in Q2FY21. Equity AUM market share also weakened from 15.8% in Q2FY20 to 13.6% in Q2FY21. SIP Market share also declined. We believe the change in top management is structurally positive for HDF AMC. We have a positive view on HDFC AMC owing to the strong brand franchise and one of the best PAT to AUM (profitability), however, the only concern investor was having, subdued AUM growth and decline in Maret share, Which would likely get gradually resolved. Currently, HDFC AMC/Nippon/UTI AMC is trading at 13.9%/8.8%/3.4% of AUM, premium valuation for HDFC due to strong brand franchise and operationally well managed AMC.""  11. 38 AM: Gold prices today  Gold prices edged lower on Tuesday as investors weighed concerns over  optimism over positive developments around a second possible COVID-19 vaccine. However, spiking coronavirus cases globally kept losses checked in the bullion metal.  Spot gold was flat at $1,890.27 per ounce, while U.S. gold futures were stable  at $1,889.70.  11. 22 AM: Gold outlook  Speaking on gold's outlook, Anuj Gupta, DVP- Commodities and Currencies Research, Angel Broking said,"" Yesterday, Gold prices closed 0.31% lower at 50,830 levels and silver closed 0.17% lower at 63,691 levels on the back of recovery in global equity market.""  He added,"" Development on the front of corona virus vaccine put pressure on gold and silver as the safe haven demand may fade out. Supply also expected to rise in the coming days from the major gold mines as workers may return and resume production of the metal. The trend of Gold and silver now become sideways to down and expectation of safe haven demand of this asset may fade out.""  On today's tehcnical outlook, he said,"" As for today traders can go for sell in gold at Rs 51000 levels with the stop loss of Rs 51300 levels for the target of 50500 levels. They can also go for sell  in Silver at Rs 64,000 levels, with the stop loss of 64600 levels and for the target of 62800 levels.""  11. 10 AM: ONGC Q2 outlook  Jyoti Roy - DVP- Equity Strategist, Angel Broking said,"" ONGC reported a 17.7% YoY degrowth in consolidated revenue from operations to Rs 83,619 crore for Q2FY21, due to fall in realizations across all segments including E&P, offshore and refining & marketing. EBIDTA for the quarter stood at Rs 13,869 crore down by 13.4% YoY. Net profit after minority interest for the quarter was down by 18.9% YoY to Rs 4,336 crore as compared to profit of Rs 5349 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. During the quarter while there was no major loss of production numbers were adversely impacted due to sharp drop in realizations which resulted in a 49% drop in E&P EBIT to Rs 4,450 crore. However the refining and marketing division did well for the company with segment EBIT up by 462% YoY to Rs 3,735 crore. While the company has posted a decent set of numbers for the quarter we expect that the E&P business will continue to  remain under pressure due to subdued crude prices while refining spreads too are expected to remain under pressure due to lower demand for products.""  11.02 AM: Tata Steel result update  Jyoti Roy - DVP- Equity Strategist, Angel Broking  said,""Tata Steel reported a 7.4% YoY growth in consolidated revenues to Rs 37,154 crore for Q2FY21, as compared to revenues of Rs 34,579 crore for Q4FY19.

Invest Now The year 2020 will definitely be remembered for the market performance as the benchmark indices witnessed a complete V-shaped fall and recovery with the Nifty50 hitting fresh record high in January and then again in November. The index surpassed Rs 100 lakh crore in market-capitalisation on November 11 due to rally for eight consecutive session. In January, there was an all-time high following several government measures, including sharp cut in corporate tax rate, but COVID-19 pandemic punctured the economic growth. The Nifty50 market-capitalisation stood at Rs 101.3 lakh crore intraday on November 11 though at closing it fell to Rs 99.88 lakh crore. The Nifty 50 stocks added Rs 41.46 lakh crore in market-capitalisation from March 23's closing low, while all stocks, barring Coal India, participated in the recovery. Out of 50, top 28 stocks rallied 61-137 percent from March closing lows, which added Rs 32.5 lakh crore in market-capitalisation. The most prominent ones which added maximum market-capitalisation were Reliance Industries, TCS, Infosys, HDFC Bank, Wipro, HCL Technologies, Bajaj Finance, ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank.  Furthermore, out of Nifty 50, top 8 stocksÂ gave multibagger returns i.e. 104-137 percent from March closing low till November 11. These were JSW Steel, IndusInd Bank, Hindalco Industries, Reliance Industries, Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, Infosys and Wipro. The Nifty50 index itself surged 67.5 percent from its March lows to end at record closing high of 12,749.15 on November 11, which is way beyond the expectations of market experts. Intraday record high for Nifty50 was 12,769.75 on same day. The major reason behind the rally and record high levels was the gush of liquidity and that is expected to continue, experts feel. FIIs have net bought Rs 29,782.31 crore worth of shares in just eight sessions of November month, against Rs 14,537.40 crore of buyinn in previous month, though DIIs took the advantage of rally to book profits and sold total more than Rs 32,000 crore of shares in both months. ""This trend is likely to continue even going forward. On the external front, we have been in a comfortable situation with large and growing Forex reserves and surplus situation on current account,"" Harsha Upadhyaya, President & CIO â€“ Equity at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company told Moneycontrol. ""Sustained FII buying is imparting strength to the market even at high levels. Investors have to be cautious at these levels and remain invested in quality largecaps. Last month witnessed lots of mutual fund redemptions & stoppage of SIPs. These decisions have already been proved wrong,"" V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services said. Another major reason was the better-than-expected September quarter earnings, which raised hopes for strong FY22 earnings and as a result, there were more upgrades than downgrades. ""Nearly 80 percent of companies have announced September quarter results until now, and have delivered much better earnings at around 22 percent year-on-year growth as compared to subdued expectations. During the earnings season, we have also seen some earnings upgrades of about 3-4 percent for FY22 by the street,"" said Harsha Upadhyaya.

Monday evening, global markets, especially Dow futures, just blew out after the news of advancement of COVID - 19 vaccine. At one point, SGX NIfty was indicating levels beyond 12800. But this euphoria subsided towards the close of US markets and hence, tracking some nervousness early in the morning in DOW futures, our market was less excited at the opening. We still managed to open nearly eight tenths of a percent higher and ended the session well above the 12600 mark. Yesterday, it was the seventh straight day when our markets experienced a strong Bull Run. In fact, markets are opening with an upside gap in the last four trading sessions. Generally, back to back 'Runaway Gaps' after a decisive breakout from crucial points indicates strong buying interest. Now with yesterday's rally, we are very much close to our mentioned target of the 'Bullish Flag' pattern i.e. 12700 - 12800. The real question is whether we are going to halt here or the rally is going to continue further? With a medium term view, we believe that it's just the beginning of mega Bull Run and 13000 and beyond levels are very much on cards. But for momentum traders, the low hanging fruit is gone and from hereon, the immediate price action will not be as smooth as it has been since the last few days. In between, we are likely to see some profit booking or time correction. For the coming session, the support can be seen around 12550 - 12475.

The stock currently looks quite undervalued as it trades at 10.4x P/E FY22E, materially lower than its long term average of 16x. This is after demonstrating its ability to secure orders, ramp up of execution, maintain margins of 19-20% after accounting for 8% of R&D expenses, manage strong free cash flows despite poor finances of the government and achieve ROE's of close to ~18% in the past three years.

While the blue wave which predicted a clean sweep for the democrats would have been the most preferred outcome of the US elections we believe that the current outcome is still acceptable as it would give the new president enough room to implement his policies. Post the US elections focus will shift to progress on the second US stimulus package and it is expected that the democrats will come to an agreement with the republicans regarding the size of the package soon. There is also expected to be a significant shift in foreign policy with the US taking a less combative tone under the new president which will be good for global trade. Though the US may maintain a relatively tough stance on China we expect significant improvement in relationship with the rest of the world which would be good for global equities.   While the markets have cheered the results, further up move from here on will be a function of smooth transition of power and passage of the second US stimulus package. Key risks for the markets which can derail the current rally are 1) further surge in Covid-19 cases globally 2) Delay in vaccine production as compared to timelines expected by markets 3) Any delay in the second US stimulus package.""  12. 51PM: Global markets  Asian markets are trading higher as investors react to victory of Joe Biden in the US Presidential race.

In spite of this, here why we think you should not stop investing in equity. Two reasons. One, as we recently saw Nifty PE was at an all-time high but the PB was still reasonably valued with respect its long-term average. The second one is the market imbalance we had referred to earlier: Return difference of Nifty 50 vs Nifty 50 Equal-weight index at an all-time high! This was seen in Dec 2019 but had started as we shall below quite a while ago. By market imbalance, we are referring to a marked difference in the returns of Nifty 50 and Nifty 50 Equal-weight. As readers may be aware, the Nifty 50 is a market capitalization based index with just a few stocks accounting for the bulk of the weight.  On the other hand, the Nifty 50 equal weight has equal exposure to all 50 stocks. Shown below is a plot of Nifty 50 TRI (green), Nifty 50 Equal-Weight TRI (black) and Nifty 50 Equal-Weight divided by Nifty 50 in red (right axis).  An increase in this ratio has corresponded to market up moves. Meaning all Nifty stocks have moved up. A fall in the ratio points to an asymmetry: top Nifty stocks have gained more than the rest of the index. The long thin arrow represents the gradual fall in N50EW/N50 ratio post the 2008-crisis recovery! We saw this in our recent study: Active mutual funds struggle to beat Nifty 50 for the last seven years! The downward arrow represents a sharp fall in the ratio since late 2017 when active fund underperformance became apparent in their star ratings. Thanks to the Marc 2020 crash, the fall in the ratio has been visibly arrested (left arrow). If your financial goals are several years away, this is a great time to invest regardless of Nifty levels. Even if the ratio hovers just above one for some time to come or moves further down, it should eventually move up. When it does, if you have enough units or stocks, your fortunes could change.  Please do not wait for the right time to invest. It is probably the worst investing mistake you can make. Although the above chart makes Nifty 50 Equal-Weight a tempting buy, it is simply too risky. The simplest way to reduce concentration risk of Nifty and yet remain a passive investor is to have some exposure to Nifty Next 50.  How much will depend on your risk appetite: See: Combine Nifty and Nifty Next 50 funds to create large, mid cap index portfolios.

The way we moved in the last couple of days, we anticipated a possible breakout in the upward direction.We have finally broken out from some crucial resistance and hence, looking at the price behavior, we expect this northward move to continue towards 12250 – 12400 now. But since, the actual verdict is yet to come; we cannot just overlook this development. Traders should keep a close track of it and how markets react post the outcome. But despite this, we still believe that in case of any weakness 12000 – 11900 should now act as a sheet anchor for the bulls. Yesterday, almost all sectors participated in the rally, which is always considered a healthy sign for the market. Also, we would like to highlight that the NIFTY MIDCAP 50 index which was consolidating and interestingly placed since the last few days, has finally confirmed a huge breakout on the daily chart. Mostly it is observed that Mid and Small cap indices confirm a bigger breakout only when the market feels that the uncertainty is behind us and is likely to witness some strong rally in the near future. Going by this logic, it adds more conviction and hence, we expect some encouraging moves to come in the broader market.

The trend of the index is positive and we should work towards a target of 12300-12400. Since the markets have run up in the last couple of days, it would be best to accumulate the Nifty on dips for higher targets.

Read More Indian markets ended on a weak note tracking sharp volatility in US stock futures and caution ahead of the quarterly earnings of index giant Reliance Industries. Nifty has formed spinning bottom formation on a daily basis, which is an indication of the indecisive trend. The benchmark index has managed to hold the level of 50 days Exponential Moving Average, which was at 11530. In the coming week, we could see stock-specific activity till the market doesn't cross the trading range of 11750 and 11530 on either side. The markets broke yesterday's low of 11600 and this makes the Nifty bearish in the short term. Ideally it should fall further and touch 11400-11450 levels. The upside is capped at 11900-11950 so traders can consider a closing above those levels as a stop loss and initiate short positions for a target of 11400. Markets were volatile today as reflected in the VIX which has risen close to 300bps over the last few sessions. Autos witnessed profit booking today although a late comeback by RIL ahead of its earnings today evening helped indices gain some lost ground in afternoon trade.    Indian market is moving in tandem with global trends which is displaying weakness as a new round of coronavirus lockdown is weighing on the future growth & outlook. Indian rally was supported by good Q2 results and economic data. The sustenance of economic data will be difficult in the next quarter due to restrictions affecting world growth, global uncertainties over the US presidential election and timing of stimulus. : Benchmark indices ended lower for the third consecutive day on October 30 dragged by auto and FMCG names. At close, the Sensex was down 135.78 points or 0.34% at 39614.07, and the Nifty was down 28.40 points or 0.24% at 11642.40. About 1322 shares have advanced, 1222 shares declined, and 167 shares are unchanged. Bharti Airtel, Hero MotoCorp, Eicher Motors, Maruti Suzuki and HUL were among major losers on the Nifty, while gainers included Adani Ports, BPCL, Coal India, Sun Pharma and Tata Steel. Except auto, bank and FMCG other sectoral indices ended higher. BSE Midcap index gained 0.6 percent, while BSE Smallcap index ended flat. Prabhudas Lilladher increase FY21E earnings estimates by 45% to incorporate inventory gains of Rs 30 bn in H1FY21 and make minor changes and increase FY22-23E by 5%. During Q2FY21, core standalone EBIDTA adjusted for inventory gains and forex gains was low at Rs 12.5 bn (-63%QoQ) due to lower core refinery ($1.6/bbl vs $1.9/bbl in Q1FY21) and marketing earnings. Weak global demand and high inventory levels are likely to keep crude oil prices range bound, which will support marketing margins in medium term. Meanwhile GRMs will recover with pickup in economic activity and lower operating cost (due to soft spot LNG prices) will support refining earnings. BPCL remains one of the preferred divestment play in the oil and gas sector however, with uncertain timelines broking house cut target multiple to PER of 9x FY22E (10x earlier). Maintain buy with a target price of Rs 479 (Rs 515 earlier). The BSE-30 Index declined 2.8% in the current week. Market mood was wary on a steady increase in daily Covid-19 cases globally despite falling cases in India and uncertainty around the upcoming US elections. Nestle and Asian Paints were among the major gainers while State Bank of India, ONGC and Sun Pharmaceuticals lost the most in the BSE-30 Index in the past week. FPIs bought equities worth USD 695 mn over the past five trading sessions while DIIs sold USD 740 mn worth of equities in the same period. Even though second quarter corporate earnings numbers have been encouraging so far, markets are showing signs of weakness. Our advice would be to take advantage of a potential market correction to build a portfolio of good quality stocks. The company witnessed healthy traction in order booking. This, coupled with bottoming out of retail vertical, improvement in cloud revenues and ramp up in financial services vertical, will lead to healthy improvement in revenues in the long term. Further, improving margins are expected to boost the bottomline. Hence, ICICIdirect upgrade the stock from hold to buy with a revised target price of Rs 210 (9x FY23E EPS). Nifty Metal Index added 1 percent supported by the Coal India, Tata Steel, SAIL: Prices of silver and industrial metals are likely to remain negative, due to the rising global Covid infections, which are causing concerns about weaker global economic growth. Metals are also trading negative, due to the strength in the Dollar Index against major currencies. The Dollar Index has rallied from last week’s low of 92.46, to a high of 94.14 this week, which is 1.8% higher, and it is currently trading at a four-week high. Silver prices are likely to find support near the 200-days EMA at $22.05, while critical resistance is seen near $24.81-$25.98 levels. Benchmark indices erased some of the losses but still trading lower with Nifty above 11600.

This means the Nifty 50 was priced at 34.87..25 Oct 2020",https://freefincal.com/nifty-pe-at-all-time-high-will-the-market-crash/,25 Oct 2020,Nifty PE at all-time high: Will the market crash?,"Home ⇒ Stock Market ⇒ Nifty PE at all-time high: Will the market crash? Published: October 25, 2020 at 10:54 am Last Updated on December 29, 2021 at 5:48 pm On 14th Oct 2020, the Nifty P/E ratio or PE ratio was 34.87. This was an all-time high from 1st Jan 1999. This means the Nifty 50 was priced at 34.87 times its earnings. The latest PE ratio at the time of publication is 34.37 (23rd Oct 2020). Investors are worried if this high PE is an indicator of a market crash. A discussion on the current state of the market. Let us start with the Nifty PE from 1st Jan 1999 to Oct 23rd 2020 with 10-year moving average and first and second standard deviation bands. All graphs in this article were created with the Nifty Valuation Tool. The encircled region points to the all-time high. Nifty PE believers may point out that the “correction” has already begun. However, there are several features in this graph that require careful inspection and assimilation. The Nifty PB from 1st Jan 1999 to Oct 23rd 2020 with 10-year moving average and first and second standard deviation bands is shown below. This paints an entirely different picture. If you appreciate honesty, we do not know; we cannot know. How about trying to time the market with Nifty PE? if you appreciate opinions that originate only from data, see Market Timing with Index PE Ratio: Tactical Asset Allocation Backtest. If you prefer to follow “commonsense” and “intuition” then good luck with trying to slip between raindrops without getting wet. Market timing with the PE ratio does work but not the way we want! It is an efficient way to lower risk more often than not. Whether this effort results in more returns is pretty much potluck. See: Want to time the market with Nifty PE? Learn from Franklin Dynamic PE Fund. NB: Franklin has now included PB in its strategy. This study predates that. As readers may be aware, different types of market timing strategies have been backtested and among these the one that has worked more often than not (higher returns) is based on the momentum of the six months moving average relative to the twelve-month moving average. See: This “buy high, sell low” market timing strategy surprisingly works! In summary, a high PE does not mean much. If you wish to use the Nifty PE for market timing, you should expect lower risk and not higher returns. New investors are always assuming if they buy during dips, they can get more returns. Sorry, it does not work that way: Want to time the market? Then do it right! Buying on dips is not timing! We do not know which way the market is heading in the future, however, I am certain about one thing: waiting for the market to fall is the worst mistake an investor can do. Whether or not you choose to time the market, systematic investment is essential. Those who deploy a tactical strategy quietly act on it; own up to it; They do not go around “discussing” it in personal finance forums.

Invest Now Itâ€™s happening slowly but surely in India. Passive investing in India has been gaining ground. The assets under management (AUM) of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that track the Nifty 50 index as the benchmark have crossed a new milestone of Rs 1 Trillion in August 2020. Also, the total AUM of the ETF (Equity & Debt) industry in India has crossed Rs 2 Trillion in October 2020. ETFs are mutual fund schemes traded on the BSE and the NSE just like equity shares. An ETF simply invests its entire corpus in all the securities and in the same proportion as its benchmark index composition. An ETF is not meant to outperform the benchmark index. You need a demat account to buy an ETF. Active large-cap funds find it tougher beat benchmarks It has been getting tougher for actively-managed funds â€“ especially large-cap schemes â€“ to outperform their benchmark indices. Fund houses have been now mandated to benchmark their funds against total return indices. Since these indices also include dividends, they are tougher to beat. Weak markets and very few stocks in benchmark indices outperforming have also resulted in underperformance of actively-managed funds.  EPFO lends a large helping hand A significant part behind Nifty ETFsâ€™ staggering growth is the governmentâ€™s decision to invest 15 percent of the Employees Provident Fund Organisationâ€™s (EPFOâ€™s) annual deposits in ETFs. EPFO has been investing in the stock market since August 2015 via ETFs. Apart from investing in Nifty as well as Sensex ETFs, the EPFO also invests in government disinvestment ETFs such as the Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSE) ETF and Bharat-22 ETF.  ETFs trading volumes rise This resulted in more fund houses warming up to passive funds. Apart from index schemes, fund houses also started rolling out ETFs. Currently, there are 17 ETFs tracking benchmarks such as the Nifty 50 index. Increased interest, especially from institutional investors, resulted in traded volume going up significantly.  Retail participation is low in ETFs As per an analysis of the data put out by the Association of Mutual Funds of India, just about 1.7 per cent of the overall equity and debt ETFsâ€™ pie belong to retail investors. Corporate investors, on the other hand, constitute close to 90 percent. The reason: EPFO is treated as a corporate investor since this is a retirement fund managed by the government of India.  Low expense ratios While most ETFs are modest in size, those that get steady inflows from EPFOs, such as SBI ETF Nifty 50 and UTI Nifty ETF are significantly large in size. In fact, at a corpus size of Rs 74867 crore, SBI ETF Nifty 50 is the countryâ€™s largest mutual fund scheme. Stiff competition among ETFs to attract the central government towards choosing the disinvestment vehicle has also resulted in a fall in expense ratios across the board.

The Nifty has gone sideways - we are around the mid point of the range where 11650 is the lower end and 12050 is the upper end. Unless we do not cross one of these levels we will not see a substantial move and hence a trade in either direction may trigger a stop loss. Traders should be cautious when trading a range and if at all they end up trading, they should consider smaller quantities to encapsulate the stops. If we get past 12050, we can trade for a target of 12300 and if we break 11650, we can trade for a downward target of 11450.

Yesterday, global cues were a bit subdued early in the morning and despite this, our markets opened lower and then extended losses as the day progressed. The weakness was mainly led by the IT counters, that were experiencing heavy profit taking after a recent relentless run. Then banking joined hands to drag the markets lower. But all of a sudden at the stroke of the penultimate hour, markets just took off and financials were the major charioteer to this late surge. Eventually, Nifty not only recouped losses but also ended well inside the positive territory. In last couple of days, markets cooled off a bit after reaching the 12000 mark; but with yesterday’s sharp recovery, 11800 has now become a sacrosanct support.Nifty precisely attracted buyers in the support area of 11867 - 11800 and fortunately, we managed to participate in the sudden up move in the banking space. Now the way banking index is shaped up, there is a high possibility that we may see a convincing move beyond 12000 for Nifty today. As far as levels are concerned, 12050-12100 are the next levels to watch out for; whereas on the downside, 11900-11800 have become immediate supports. Since last few days, we have been continuously mentioning how broader market is quiet and remained unmoved in the recent rally. But yesterday, in the last hour surge, midcap index too participated well and a follow up in the coming session, would certainly bode well for the bulls.

Invest Now It has been an exciting journey for investors since Sensex, Nifty touched their all-time low back in March. Since then it has been a one-way journey and that is on the upside. After hitting a low of 7,500 in March, bulls helped Nifty to reclaim lost glory. Although it is still a bear market rally, but Nifty managed to reclaim 11,000 on July 20. The Nifty50 rallied by about 1,000 points from 11,000 (hit on July 20) to 12,000 (touched intraday) on October 12. During the same period, 5 stocks more than doubled investors wealth and 24 stocks rose 50-100%. Stocks in the BSE500 index which more than doubled are Laurus Labs, IndiaMart InterMesh, Welspun India, Himatsingka Seide and Advanced Enzyme. Note: The list is only for reference and not buy or sell ideas:  24 stocks that rose 50-100% include KPR Mills, Tata Elxsi, Sunteck Realty, IDFC, IFB Industries, Somany Ceramics and Adani Enterprises. After witnessing about 1,000-point rally, Nifty50 could take a breather. We saw Nifty50 losing momentum the moment it touched 12000 levels on Monday. Although the trend still remains to be on the upside some consolidation in the near term cannot be ruled out, suggest experts. “After a swift rally of more than 1000 points, a mild pullback cannot be ruled out. Though the outlook on the market is still bullish and traders are suggested to keep a buy on dips approach,” Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Group told Moneycontrol. “The immediate support and resistance levels to be watched in the short term are 10700 and 12020 respectively. Quarterly results will pick up the pace next week onwards after a strong earnings result by TCS this week,” he said. Where is the Nifty headed? The Nifty50 formed Doji kind of pattern on daily charts that suggest a loss of momentum. If Nifty50 fails to reclaim 12000 levels in the coming few session, chances of consolidation or profit taking will become more prominent. The Nifty shifted into a consolidation with a narrow range movement on Monday. It closed higher with gains of 16 points. Technically, this pattern could be considered as a high wave type pattern which reflects high volatility in the market at the swing highs. “The overall market breadth has been an area of concern for the benchmark Nifty over the last few sessions. The broad market indices like small-cap and large-cap have continued to show underperformance and continued with minor weakness on Monday, which has resulted in a negative advance-decline ratio,” Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told Moneycontrol. “The Doji type confusing pattern of 8th Oct has also been nullified recently and Nifty close above it (11905). Hence, all these positive evidence could signal more upside for the market ahead,” he said. Shetti further added that the underlying short term trend of Nifty continues to be positive. The present consolidation pattern could end soon and Nifty could resume its uptrend in the coming sessions. “The upside levels to be watched around 12250 for the next 3-4 sessions. Immediate support is placed at 11850,” he said. Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Invest Now After a decent correction, bulls came roaring back this truncated week pushing benchmark indices higher by 3 percent, the best weekly gain since May. The action was not limited to benchmark indices as small and midcap stocks also participated equally in the holiday-shortened week. Indian market remained shut on Friday on account of a public holiday. The S&P BSE Sensex rose 3.5 percent while the Nifty50 was up 3.3 percent in the week ended October 1. S&P BSE Midcap index and the S&P BSE Smallcap index closed with gains of about 3.3 percent each in the same period. As many as 27 stocks that rallied 10-30 percent in just four trading sessions. These include KEC International, Delta Corp, L&T Finance Holding, Dish TV, Welspun India, PVR, and Himatsingka Seide Ltd among others.  A large part of the rally was led by global cues amid expectations of another round of stimulus from the US government. Domestic cues such as upbeat September auto sales numbers, robust GST collections as well as Unlock 5 also supported market sentiment. “Markets posted decent gains last week, thanks to upbeat global markets and favourable local cues. Among the key factors, rising hope of a stimulus package in the US and guidelines on Unlock 5 boosted the sentiment,” Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking Ltd told Moneycontrol. “Besides, the rising trend of auto sales numbers in September month for the passenger vehicles and tractor segments also cheered investors,” he said. The action in the coming week is likely to be dominated by September quarter earnings, Supreme Court’s decision on the interest waiver. On the global front, any update on the US President's COVID situation will also be closely monitored. Mishra is of the view that the next week marks the beginning of earnings season and among the top names, IT major, TCS, is scheduled to announce its number on October 7. Besides, news related to COVID-19 and updates on the US Presidential election will also be closely tracked. Technical View:  The Nifty50 formed a bullish candle on the daily and weekly charts for the week that ended on October 1. It closed above 5-Days Exponential Moving Average as well as 50-Days EMA. Experts are of the view that the banking theme which led the rally from the front is likely to dominate the price action in the coming week along with FII activity. The S&P BSE Bankex closed with gains of over 6 percent followed by the S&P BSE Consumer Durable index which rose 5.7 percent. The rebound in banking and financials is a welcome relief as other sectors. The breakout above 11,300 in Nifty has again shifted the bias in the favour of bulls. “Based on the derivative data FIIs are playing a crucial role in the broader direction of the market. In the past, ahead of the US elections most of the time FIIs have proved right in terms of market direction,” Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research at Kotak Securities told Moneycontrol. “On Monday, 11460 and 11450 would be major hurdles for the Nifty 50 index, however, the outcome from the Supreme Court on the interest waiver would decide the broader trend for the market. The index would find supports at 11300 and 11250 levels,” he said.

Invest Now Bears remained in control of D-Street for the fifth consecutive day in a row on September 23 pushing the Nifty50 below50-Day Moving Average (DMA) (11,294), and 50-Day EMA (11,190). The 50-DMA, also known as the short-term moving average, is considered by many traders as a signal of near-term trend of the market. On the downside, it acts as crucial support for the index, but a break below these levels suggests a change in the trend. This is just a signal and traders should not consider it as a final word but as a sign that the near-term trend could be tilting towards bears. “As such 50-Day Moving Average (or any other moving average) may not have significance in initiating a trade unless the index or stock respected the said average couple of times in the recent past. However, its significance is of utmost importance while gauging the strength of the trade over a medium-term period which is generally believed to be a period around 3 months and is very subjective thing,” Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in told Moneycontrol. “If the index is consistently trading below the said average then it can be a sentiment dampener to hint that a prolonged correction both time-wise, as well as price-wise, is in the offing,” he said. Mohammad further added that in the current scenario Nifty after registering a sustainable close above the 50-Day Moving Average on May 27 consistently traded above it for a period of 83 sessions before decisively closing below it. Not just Nifty, but there 260 stocks that are trading below this crucial short-term moving average, data from AceEquity showed. Here is a list of top 50 stocks filtered based on the market price that are trading below 50-DMA:   Why is it important?  Traders use Moving Averages as a support or resistance tool in a trending market. It also helps to identify the trend direction of the market. The crossover of moving averages gives an indication of which side the trend is shifting, suggest expert. But, the exponential moving average is more popular than the simple moving average. Whenever the short-term moving average crosses the long-term moving average on the upward side, we call it as a positive crossover that suggests a trend is positive and vice-versa. “EMA (exponential moving average) is more popular than SMA/DMA (simple moving average/daily moving average) as EMA is faster than SMA in term of shifting with the price movement.  SMA and EMA are calculated differently,” Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research at Kotak Securities told Moneycontrol. “The 50 days SMA or EMA captures a bigger trend for stock or the index. The market gives a larger degree of price correction if the price of index/stock goes below the level of 50 days SMA/EMA and opposite to it is true for the larger degree of trending move.  Along with 50-DMA, even 200 DMA is also famous amongst traders and large institutions,” he said. What does history say? The last time when 50-DMA was breached back in the month of February.  The Nifty50 went on to make a low of 7,500 before bouncing back. “The Nifty index usually follows support near 50-DEMA which is known as a short-term moving average. After 83 trading sessions, it is going below 50 DEMA which is giving a sign of weakness in the market,” Chandan Taparia, Vice President | Analyst-Derivatives at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd told Moneycontrol. “Earlier it crossed 50-DEMA at the beginning of July moth by surpassing 9,900 zones and thereafter it rallied towards 11,800 zones in just two months,” he said. Technical Outlook The Nifty50 closed in the red for the fifth day in a row. The crucial support for the Nifty50 is placed near 11,000 while on the upside still resistance is placed at 11,300-11,500 levels. In the short-term, the market is in a corrective pattern. The index has been forming a corrective A-B-C formation, in that it has already completed wave A and wave B.  C is trending and in progress, say experts. “It should end the corrective pattern between 11,000 to 10,800 levels.  In case the price fails to bounce back from 10,800 levels then it would extend further to 10,500 levels.  However, technically we feel the Nifty should bounce back from 10,950 or 10,850 levels,” Chouhan of Kotak Securities said. “On the upside, 11,300 and 11,450 would be major hurdles. A breach of 11,800, after the completion of the corrective pattern, would lead to a massive rally towards previous ATH (All-Time High),” he said.

Invest Now The Nifty has gained about 50 percent from the lows in March 2020. The markets havenâ€™t corrected despite Indiaâ€™s first quarter GDP growth plunging to a multidecadal low. There is still a lot of chatter around the fact that the markets currently don't reflect the fundamentals. There are many questions in a retail investorâ€™s mind:Â  is it a good time to buy? Will the market go up from here or is it a good time to sell? Stock market experts and analysts too, present differing views. Here a not-so-often used ratio can come to the rescue. As per Investopedia, the Bond Equity Earnings yield Ratio (BEER) is a yardstick used to evaluate the relationship between bond yields and earnings yields in the stock market. Earnings yield is just the inverse of the price-to-earnings (P-E) multiple. The BEER is simply Bond Yield divided by Earnings Yield. If the ratio is above 1.0 the stock market is said to be overvalued; a reading of less than 1.0 indicates the stock market is undervalued. In the Indian context, we recommend using a variant of this ratio, which for simplicity, we have named PREITY (PRice Earnings by Inverse of Tbill Yield). Using this ratio will help retail investors track the stock markets, make decisions regarding asset allocation and optimize returns. PREITY Ratio = (P-E Ratio X 91 Day T-Bill Yield) / 100) The P-E ratio is available on a daily basis on the NSE website since 2000. Data on the 91 day T-Bill primary rate can be sourced from RBIâ€™s website as well as from the sites of any debt market trading aggregator. We have used the 91-day Treasury bill as it coincides with the frequency of quarterly results announcements of listed companies. It is also at the lowest end of the tenure spectrum and thereby captures the sentiment regarding prevailing interest rates. The chart below depicts the ratio over the last 20 years.  In order to simplify the visual we have also incorporated a range band (0.70-1.95) capturing PREITYâ€™s trend. (Statistically, it depicts PREITYâ€™s 1.5x standard deviation). Whenever PREITY is at or above 1.95 then itâ€™s a signal to sell and a buy signal gets triggered whenever itâ€™s at or below 0.7. PREITYâ€™s average weekly movement shows that it has hovered within 0.70 to 1.95 band about 90 percent of the time during the last 20 years. Also, during this period, whenever PREITY has either increased or decreased. Niftyâ€™s average weekly close too has correspondingly increased or decreased, about 80 percent of the time. PREITY tends to move uni-directionally. Once it breaches 1.95 it keeps falling till it reaches 0.7 and after that it starts rising till it again reaches 1.95 and thus the cycle continues. Till date, it has completed two full cycles. Now, between Feb 2015 and May 2020 it completed one half of that cycle (1.95 to 0.7).  Contrary to expectations, PREITY movementâ€™s is influenced more by interest rates rather than EPS growth. For example, between 2010 and 2013, when the Niftyâ€™s EPS grew 50 percent, the index itself rose only 20 percent because interest rates increased from 3.4 percent to 8.7 percent. Similarly, between 2013 and 2018, the Nifty doubled despite its EPS remaining flat, because interest rates had fallen to below 4 percent. In 2000 when the PREITY was higher than 2.3, Niftyâ€™s P-E was hovering between 25-26.Â  Today when the P-E is around 32, the highest level in 20 years, PREITY is around 1.0. In January 2020 when the Nifty touched its all-time high, its P-E was 28.6 and when it touched a low in May 2020, its P-E was 21.0. This shows that standalone or absolute P-E ratio levels seem to be less relevant. Our analysis shows that the Nifty has historically made new highs every time PREITY crossed 1.95 and sharply corrected till PREITY fell below 0.7 levels, post which it started rising again. PREITY has been moving in a steady pattern of either falling or rising without much sideways movement. This also coincided with Niftyâ€™s rallying and subsequent correction. However, starting 2015 till 2019 after touching 1.95, PREITY started moving sideways (within 1.5-1.9 band, barring in 2017 when it was between 1.3-1.5). During this period Nifty continued to rise and made new highs. However, even during these times if one had stuck to PREITYâ€™s guidance one would have been handsomely rewarded. For example, in Feb 2015, PREITY was at 1.95 and the Nifty at around 8700. If one had sold equity at those levels and shifted to debt then the returns would have been higher than equity. (Gilt funds over the last 5yrs have yielded around 9 percent CAGR while Nifty touched around 9k in May 2020 yielding only 0.5 percent CAGR). Hence, guided by PREITY along with patience and diligence, an investor can not only book profit on equities at an appropriate time but also optimize returns by shifting between equity and debt. Rs. 100 invested according to this strategy would have become Rs. 4,187 in 20 years while Rs. 100 invested in NIFTY would have become approx. Rs. 750. This table also in a subtle way captures the need to keep rotating / allocation between equity and debt to optimize returns.  Limitations of this ratio PREITYâ€™s peak and trough level do not coincide with Niftyâ€™s peak or trough; but within a short span of time Niftyâ€™s movement follows the PREITYâ€™s trend. NIFTY 50 reached its low of 7,610 on March 23, 2020 when the PREITY ratio was 0.95. PREITY reached the 0.7 levels only 2 months later on May 22, 2020 when NIFTY reached 8,983 levels. It helps in optimizing your returns rather than maximizing it. PREITY like its name suggest is a pretty good indicator for investment (BUY & HOLD and SELL & WAIT) rather than speculation and hence using it for trading (intra-day/week/month) may not optimize returns / turn risky It cannot be replicated on individual stocks as they are also impacted by non-P&L centric issues like balance sheet, corporate governance, industry specific issues etc. To sum up, currently the ratio is at 1.05 levels, indicating it is still some distance from 1.95. To maximize the returns, one should not worry about the current volatility and sell in panic.

We evaluate..16 Sept 2020",https://freefincal.com/nifty200-momentum-30-index-a-new-strategy-index-from-the-nse/,,Nifty200 Momentum 30 Index: A new strategy index from the NSE,"Home ⇒ Index Investing ⇒ Nifty200 Momentum 30 Index: A new strategy index from the NSE Published: September 16, 2020 at 11:23 am Last Updated on December 29, 2021 at 5:44 pm The NSE has introduced a new strategy index, Nifty200 Momentum 30 index which tracks the performance of 30 stocks with high momentum score. We evaluate the performance of the index in this article.  What is momentum investing? Invest in stocks that have moved up considerably over the past 6-12 months hoping that the trend will continue into the future (for a short period). Relevant data and links for the Indian and US markets are discussed here: Momentum Stock Investing in India: Does it work?. The BSE already has its own momentum index which has been reviewed earlier: Watch my talk on momentum and low volatility stock investing in India (also see above link). Regular readers may also be aware of our momentum and low volatility stock screener that is published monthly. This allows the user to screen for stocks based on the trailing one-year volatility, beta, six-month and 12-month momentum. A monthly historical archive of the screener is also available. Before we begin, investors should appreciate that momentum investing is a high-risk,  high-churn investing strategy. Please do not attempt to replicate index behaviour privately without understanding what it entails. As a new index, its entire history is based on backtested data. Also, a ‘thank you’ to Ashutosh on Twitter for pointing me to this index. Nifty200 Momentum 30 Index Construction: To be eligible for shortlisting the stock should be (1) part of the Nifty 200 (top 200 stocks by market cap traded in the NSE), (2) listing history of at least one year, (3) available for trading in the derivatives segment. If a stock moves out of the Nifty 200, it will also leave the momentum index at the time of review. Each stock will have a maximum weight limit of 5% which will be done at the time of semi-annual rebalancing (June and December). There shall also be a quarterly compliance review.  The weight is determined using the formula: free-float market cap x Normalised Momentum Score.  The index will consist of 30 stocks with the highest normalised momentum score. The normalised momentum score is based on a combination of 6-month and 12-month momentum. First, a momentum ratio is defined as return divided by the standard deviation.  So a 6-month momentum ratio is a six-month return divided by the standard deviation of daily returns over the last year and a 12-month momentum ratio is 12-month return divided by the standard deviation of daily returns over the last year. Reference: NSE index methodology document The six-month momentum and 12-month momentum Z-scores are defined relative to the average 6,12-month momentum ratio and standard deviation of these ratios among all eligible stocks. This essentially means selecting stocks well above the average momentum score.  A Z-score pf +3 represents a performance that is three standard deviations above average.  The final momentum Z-score or the Weighted Average Z Score is 50% of 6-month Z-score plus 50% of 12-month Z-score. For positive Weighted Average Z Score, the normalised momentum score is defined as 1+ Weighted Average Z Score and negative Weighted Average Z Score, the normalised momentum score is defined as 1/(1-Weighted Average Z Score). This is done to several penalize negative Z-scores. A schematic is shown below. The top 30 stocks with the highest Normalized Momentum Score are selected for inclusion in the Nifty200 Momentum 30 Index. This is the since inception movement of Nifty200 Momentum 30 Index TRI along with Nifty 200 TRI and Nifty 50 TRI. It is important not to get mislead by such graphs as this represents a single return. Rolling returns (see below) can paint a very different picture. The maximum drawdown (max fall from all-time high) of Nifty200 Momentum 30 Index TRI along with Nifty 200 TRI and Nifty 50 TRI is shown below. During bearish phases, the momentum index investor would suffer more losses. Next, this is a comparison of Nifty200 Momentum 30 Index TRI along with BSE Sensex TRI and BSE Momentum Index TRI. The BSE momentum index has 30 stocks with the highest momentum score from BSE Largecap index. There is not much difference between the two momentum indices. We compare 2601 five-year rolling returns below. When the bull phase beings, the momentum index outperforms the base index. Rolling standard deviation (volatility) data is presented below. The momentum index has higher volatility as expected, however, the difference with respect to Nifty 50 is not surprisingly not significant. In summary, Nifty200 Momentum 30 Index is a long-expected interesting offering from the NSE. Perhaps AMCs might consider launching an ETF based on this index. They are unlikely to launch index funds as they can profit more with active thematic funds (SEBI rules permit an unlimited number of passive funds and thematic funds). Update: UTI has filed a new offer document with SEBI for a momentum index fund based on this very index! DIY replication of the momentum index will require robot-like discipline. Also the tax outgo and brokerage could be significant. So kindly tread with ample caution and due diligence. It might interest the reader to note that SBI Dynamic Asset Allocation Fund adopts a momentum strategy in part.

The Market Guru maintained that the trend is expected to continue this week as Defense Minister Rajnath Singh yesterday said in Lok Sabha that tension is still not over. Singhvi said that after this statement, it has become clear that India-China standoff is still looming on the markets and a single negative news in this regard can bring down markets to 11,200 to 11,300 levels. However, he also said that a single positive indication can pull market up to 11,700 to 11,800 mark. He advised traders to avoid overnight position while long-term investors need not  bother as fundamentals of the markets are still strong. Decoding the meaning of Defense Minister Rajnath Singh's speech yesterday in the Lok Sabha, Anil Singhvi said, ""The Defense Minister has clearly said that India China border tension is still not over. In fact, the tension has now shifted to Arunachal Pradesh also where both side's forces have enhanced their activities there."" See Zee Business Live TV streaming below:  Singhvi maintained that both countries are holding bilateral talks and a single positive breakthrough can push Indian indices to around 11,700 to 11,800 while a single negative India-China border news can bring down NSE Nifty to 11,200 to 11,300 levels.

But, for traders, they need to remain extra cautious and maintain stop loss while taking any position as markets can move both ways because no one can predict what will happen on India-China border in next few hours or days."" Singhvi advised traders to avoid holding overnight positions as there is less chance of getting benefit of gap-up or gap-down benefit next day.

You should consider whether you understand how spread bets and CFDs work and whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money.  Professional clients trading spread bets and CFDs can lose more than they deposit. Options and futures are complex instruments which come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. They’re not suitable for most investors. Before you invest, you should consider whether you understand how options and futures work, the risks of trading these instruments and whether you can afford to lose more than your original investment. Trading stocks and shares ‘on margin’ within a US options and futures account – meaning that you only finance part of the cost of acquiring a position in a security – carries additional risks over buying securities on a fully funded basis and may result in losses exceeding your original investment. Trading on margin will also result in additional costs to you as the investor and any securities purchased using margin may be held as collateral by the lender, restricting both your rights as shareholder, and your ability to use the securities until the margin trade is closed. You should familiarise yourself with these risks before trading on margin. The value of shares, ETFs and other ETPs bought through a share dealing account, a US options and futures account, a stocks and shares ISA or a SIPP can fall as well as rise, which could mean getting back less than you originally put in. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Some ETPs carry additional risks depending on how they’re structured, investors should ensure they familiarise themselves with the differences before investing.

Invest Now  Indian market rallied by about 3 percent in August despite some profit booking seen on the last trading session of the month. So can the momentum continue in September as well? Well, data from the last 10 years suggest that in the 5 out of the 10 years, Nifty50 closed in the green while for -the rest bears managed to take control of the market. After rallying for three consecutive months, the market could take a breather but given the fact that global liquidity remains strong, dips could be bought into. Foreign investors poured in close to Rs 19,000 crore in the cash segment of Indian equity markets. Historically, in September, 50 percent of the times bulls have controlled the D-Street, data from AceEquity showed.   The trend for the month of September would be dependent on global liquidity, news flow around the Coronavirus vaccine, macroeconomic trends, and news flow around US elections. September promises to remain volatile in 2020, suggest experts. “We feel it could be a highly volatile month as several events and data would unfold. Firstly, the geopolitical tension between India and China would remain one of the key things to watch out for as further escalation could lead the Indian markets to decouple from global peers,” Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking Ltd told Moneycontrol. “Additionally, apart from the fact that the current rally has been driven by global liquidity, the expectations are high that the economy is getting back on track thus crucial economic data like auto sales numbers, PMI and inflation data would also play a decisive role in setting the market direction,” he said. Mishra further added that at the same time, the global markets too could witness some profit-taking as most the growth recovery looks priced in and some nervousness could creep in as we are near the US elections. On the technical front, the Nifty September series commenced on a high note as market-wide rollover stood at almost 89% with strong rollovers in both the indices as compared to their 3 months average. The long-short ratio has jumped towards 75 percent indicating strong aggressive longs to be continued by the FII. Options bounds as of now state a likely range of 12000-11000 as 11000 PE strike commands the highest OI within the chain. “While 11500 is expected to be the mid-point of the range as denoted by the upper end of the rising trend line of the Broadening formation & reaffirmed by the OI concentration of PE & CE positions respectively,” Sacchitanand Uttekar – DVP – Technical (Equity), Tradebulls Securities told Moneycontrol. “Since the rising trend line from 11550 levels of this Expanding/Broadening formation is also progressing along with the trend, any failure of the current breakout could be arrested in case the index again slips below 11450 from hereon,” he said. With its daily RSI trending heading upwards, it is ideal to assume that despite the overbought state, the up move could continue until a reversal formation is witnessed. Uttekar further added that since upside looks limited as of now it is ideal for investors to ramp up their exposures into defensives while post the sharp upward movement traders should avoid leverage, and focus on stock-specific longs due to the overbought state of the indices. Institutional Activity:  Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have poured in by about Rs 19000 cr in the month of August, but September month has been volatile going by historical trends.  Experts are of the view that the global liquidity is likely to pour in September as well which would give support to the bulls in case of a dip or consolidation.“The central banks across the world have maintained their dovish stance and are more swayed towards getting the economy back on track. Also, India is among the top emerging markets thus we do not see the liquidity scenario changing unless something unexpected comes up,” said Mishra. FIIs were net buyers of equities in six out of the last 10 years. FIIs bought equities worth nearly Rs 30,000 crore in September 2010, followed by Rs 20,000 crore inflows in September 2012, and over Rs 12,000 crore inflows recorded in September 2013. On the other hand, DIIs were net sellers in September in 2 out of the last 10 years. They pulled out more than Rs 7,000 crore in 2010 and over Rs 3,000 crore in 2012.

READ MORE Benchmark market indices are likely to close the day on a strong note following a strong rally in banking and financial stocks. At around 2:50 pm, Sensex was trading over 400 points higher, while Nifty was crusing above 11,600 points.  Stock market investors are aware about the difficulties faced while investing in shares, especially when there is a lack of necessary information on instabilities. In times of market volatility, the uncertainty is exacerbated further when investors cannot predict the price fluctuations. Here are six key lessons that will help investors take caluclated decisions amid hieghtened volatility.   Yash Gupta, Equity Research Associate, Angel Broking Ltd: Base offer size of 3.34 crore shares and Additional option to sell 1.67 crore shares in case of oversubscription. Offer size for Non Retail Investors is 4.01 crore share and 1 crore shares for Retail Investors along with over subscription option.

The Indian rupee strengthened to its highest level in more than five months on Friday morning, helped by dollar inflows into the equity markets while gains in Asian peers also aided sentiment. The partially convertible rupee rose to a high of 73.5150 per dollar, its strongest since March 5. It had closed at 73.83 on Thursday. (Reuters)  Amarjeet Maurya, AVP - Mid Caps, Angel Broking Ltd: For 1QFY2021, Indag rubber(IRL)’s top-line de-grew by ~48% to ~Rs26cr. Top-line was negatively impacted mainly due COVID-19 lockdown which resulted in an overall slowdown of the commercial vehicle industry. On the operating front, the company reported loss of ~Rs0.5cr (against profit of ~Rs3.8cr in 1QFY20) due to negative impact of operating leverage. On the bottom-line front, IRL reported loss of ~Rs0.4cr (against profit of ~Rs2.9cr in 1QFY20) due to lower sales and poor operating performance. Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives, Angel Broking: On Thursday morning, global bourses looked a bit sluggish but despite this, our markets started off with a bump up above the 11600 mark. At the opening itself, Nifty and Bank Nifty marked their new six-month highs. But this was followed by a period of complete lull in the market, thereby making it extremely dull expiry. For the major part of the day, Nifty kept gyrating in a slender range of 25-30 points and eventually with a small decline, Nifty ended the day with negligible gains; but the August expiry panned out quite well above the 11550 mark. Due to yesterday's lethargic activity, we do not see any major development on the chart. As far as the resistances are concerned, 11600-11650 remains to be the levels to watch and on the downside, 11500 followed by 11440 should be treated as key supports going forward. The approach pretty much remains the same; where one should avoid index specific trade for a while (at least on the long side) and should focus on individual stocks by following strict stop losses. Yesterday, mostly the gains were contributed by the banking conglomerates as we saw sheer outperformance throughout the day (similar to last few days). In the broader market too, only selective stocks performed well and hence, one needs to be very fussy going ahead when it comes to the stock selection.   Indian benchmark indices S&P BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty 50 opened higher on Friday. At 9:20 am, Sensex was up 2017.86 points at 39,331.33, while Nifty was trading 55.15 points higher at 11,614.40.  Both benchmark indices were trading higher in the pre-opening session. S&P BSE Sensex was up over 150 points while NSE Nifty 50 was above 11,500.  The GST Council has hinted that the Indian economy has been grossly underperforming this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. While yesterday's meeting was held to resolve two serious concerns -- unpaid compensation to states and shortfall in revenue. States have now been given two options. Simply put, the Centre has asked states to borrow money to meet the shortfall -- something that states had earlier protested against. However, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's statement on severe economic disruptions can impact the market negatively during Friday's trading session.  Benchmark Indian indices, S&P BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty 50 are expected to open higher on Friday as per SGX Nifty trends. However, the fact that global markets are witnessing choppy trade may impact domestic market proceedings. It may be noted that Indian indices have continued rally throughout the week. However, markets have failed to keep up the momentum, losing much of the gains ahead of closing. Banking stocks have been a saving grace for markets, rallying for much of the week. It remains to be seen if banking stocks can keep up the momentum after Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das’s warning to banks yesterday.",nifty points investors market sensex

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. Small & midcaps have hogged the limelight since March as liquidity started chasing growth and undervalued stocks. Most of the largecaps were trading at high valuations, and after 2 years of underperformance small & midcap stocks were looking attractive. Benchmark indices have rallied by about 50 percent from the lows, but are still negative on a year-to-date (YTD) basis. Technicals suggest that the bull run is likely to continue for some more time but risk-to-reward is not favourable; hence, it makes sense to remain stock specific. “The valuations of some small and midcaps had fallen significantly over the last 2-3 years. The market had polarized into a handful of extremely overvalued, mostly, consumption-oriented, popular stocks, and the rest of the market was divided into capital destroyers and eroders which were rightfully cheap,” Dr. Vikas Gupta, CEO & Chief Investment Strategist at OmniScience Capital told Moneycontrol. “Many companies with strong balance sheets, persistent advantages but ignored by the market due to less familiarity, inaccurate analysis & misguided perceptions which were at significant discounts to their intrinsic values,” he said. Gupta further added that the March downturn in the market caused a few sophisticated fund managers or investors to do a fresh search across markets to find new opportunities. “These ended up driving the rebound in the stocks with strong balance sheets and strong growth opportunities but mispriced, which we alluded to above,” he explained. The road ahead The road ahead for benchmark indices might not be that exciting but stock-specific action may well continue, say, experts. Indian market is mimicking what is happening across the globe. US markets has hit a fresh record high and the rub-off effect is seen in emerging markets and India is no exception. We are not yet out of COVID neither in the US nor in India. Hence, what we are seeing is a hope rally. Yes, certain companies would benefit from the pent-up demand as and when the economy starts to claw back to normalcy but that is still some time away. The ideal approach right now is to sit tight if you have already invested or wait for a dip to put in fresh cash at current levels. “Globally most developed markets (i.e. Nasdaq Composite, Dow Jones, S&P 500 and MSCI World Index) are trading at new peak valuations. Even the 2-Year Fw PE of these markets is either at par or above the peak valuations seen in the last 15 years (on Fw PE basis). In India, the Nifty-50 has historically peaked out at ~19x on Forward PE basis,” Rusmik Oza, Executive Vice President, Head of Fundamental Research at Kotak Securities told Moneycontrol. “The Index is now trading at 18.5x on Mar’22 EPS estimates, which is very close to its historic peaks. As bond yields globally are at historic low levels the valuations of equities could remain at elevated levels. Today for example the Bond PE in India is close to ~17x, which will allow Equity PE to remain 200-300 bps above that level,” he said. Oza further added that we are somewhere nearing the peak but the ample liquidity, falling Dollar Index and lower bond yields are working in favour of equities as of now. “Extremely rich valuations has made the risk-reward ratio quite unfavourable. The upside could be in mid-single digit whereas the downside could be in higher double digits,” he explains.

It was in sync with a positive opening in the European markets which is banking on additional stimulus measures to aid economic recovery.

Tomorrow is the monthly F&O expiry day. Though index volatility has been limited in the past month, stock specific moves have been large and hence we could see some sharp moves in select stocks on squaring up/rolling over of positions. Tomorrow is also the much anticipated speech by the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve.

Top US and Chinese trade officials reaffirmed their commitment to a Phase 1 trade deal which was in question few months back, this gave boost to the financial market, hammering the bullion's down. On data front, US consumer confidence unexpectedly fell in August to hit a six-year low. On the other hand new home sales recorded a significant increase. Investors today will focus on the US Core durable goods orders data and weaker-than-expected economic data could keep the dollar weighed down and support precious metals at lower levels. Market participants now also await speech by US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell tomorrow where he is expected to address the US central bank's view on inflation and monetary policy.

We expect the broader markets to be in range bound and may see some pressure due to sector specific profit booking.  While the near-term sales growth trajectory is unclear, P&G Healthcare has a more resilient portfolio than peers to withstand the COVID-19-related disruption in the post-lockdown phase. Changes to the model have led to a 4.8/4 percent increase in FY21/FY22 EPS. Although valuations are expensive at 51.8x FY22E EPS, implying near-term upside is limited, two factors make the company an attractive long-term core holding - huge category growth potential in the Feminine Hygiene segment (~70 percent of sales) and potential for market share gains due to considerable moats, and huge potential margin gains from premiumization in Feminine Hygiene over the long term.

Held on the 2nd OR 3rd Sunday of every month, across top cities in India Invest Now Powered By  This functionality will provide users with ease of access navigation and enable create a new revenue line by generating leads of potential customers for brokers in a more integrated manner. Invest Now Bhavana Acharya That the Nifty Next 50 index is a great one to hold is old news. Using it as part of your portfolio, though, means that you need to understand how the index behaves. Why? You would think that being made up of large-cap stocks, it would be akin to holding a large-cap fund or index. On the contrary, the Nifty Next 50 behaves more like a mid-cap play than a large-cap one. On the basis of a variety of metrics, the Nifty Next 50 has more similarities with the Nifty Midcap 100 than the Nifty 100. Hereâ€™s more, plus how you can use the index in your portfolio. Do note that the TRI indices have been used throughout in this analysis. Loss probabilities higher The one characteristic about mid-caps is that they soar far higher than large-caps during market upswings and crash much more in corrective periods. Now, consider the past decade. The Nifty 50 and the Nifty 100 slipped into losses 22 per cent of the time when looking at one-year returns. The Nifty Next 50, though, suffered losses 28 per cent of the time. The Nifty Midcap 100 was loss-making 34 per cent of the time. Going further back to 15 years also shows a similar trend.  And not just that. The extent of the loss in the Nifty Next 50 is also larger. That is, the losses in the Nifty Next 50 have been more on an average than the Nifty 50 or the Nifty 100. Therefore, in terms of loss tendencies, the Nifty Next 50 deviates a good bit away from the main large-cap indices. The Next 50â€™s loss characteristic shows up in downside capture as well. Downside capture is measure that reveals how much one index (or fund) falls in comparison to a benchmark index. That is, it shows the proportion of the benchmarkâ€™s loss an index captures. Take the Nifty 50 as the main market indicator. Then take the period from 2009 to date and all the times the index has been loss-making on a three-month period. The Nifty 100 index falls just as much as the Nifty 50 does. But the Nifty Next 50 falls 4 per cent more on an average than the Nifty 50. Thatâ€™s very similar to the broad-market Nifty 500, which falls 6 per cent more than the Nifty 50. Pull this out into a longer one-year period, since short-term market movements can even out. Here, the Nifty Next 50 fell 13 per cent more, on an average, than the Nifty 50. The Nifty Midcap 100 fell 20 per cent more than the Nifty 50, on an average. Volatility higher Volatility measures how much returns fluctuate. Midcaps and small-caps, of course, top the volatility charts. But the Nifty Next 50 is similar to the Nifty Midcap 100 on the volatility metric. Across different timeframes, the Nifty Next 50â€™s return deviation is closer to the Nifty Midcap 100 than the Nifty 100 or the Nifty 50.  But upside also higher However, this volatility also means that when the Nifty Next 50 rises, it thoroughly eclipses the Nifty 100. Consider one-year returns, just as in the section above. In all the times that the Nifty 50 gained, the Nifty Next 50 gained 33 per cent more on an average. Thatâ€™s better than even the Nifty Midcap 100. The average gain the Nifty Next 50 clocked was a good 30.8 per cent compared to the Nifty 100â€™s 20.6 per cent.  And this is where the benefit of holding the Nifty Next 50 comes in. Despite its volatility and higher loss tendencies, the strong performance it manages during upswings takes overall returns much higher. This characteristic is thanks to the Next 50 being a catchment of sorts for stocks growing into the large-cap category from being mid-caps. During rallying markets, the bigger mid-cap stocks can clock very strong gains and move into the large-cap basket and into the Next 50. At the same time, the index also holds those stocks that have dropped out of the main Nifty 50, which have an effect similar to getting into some under-valued stocks. Given that these indices are market-cap weighted, the Nifty 100 is driven almost entirely by the Nifty 50. This leaves the Nifty Next 50 very different from both the Nifty 50 and the Nifty 100. Investing in the Nifty Next 50  So how can you use the Next 50 in your portfolio? One, the index will fall under the aggressive part of your portfolio, which you use to drive overall returns higher. Two, it should not be considered as a substitute for large-caps, because it does not fit the stable, moderate risk, lower volatile need that large-caps do. Three, for the same reason, avoid putting away a large chunk of your portfolio in the index despite its attractive returns. You can pair it with large-cap funds or the Nifty 100 or the Nifty 50. Remember, despite the higher returns, there are times where the Next 50 may fail to match up to the Nifty 100 â€“ recent returns, for example, have the Next 50 lagging. Also note that holding the Nifty 50 and the Next 50 is not the same as holding the Nifty 100. Conservative and moderate-risk investors can use this index instead of midcaps, or blended with a small allocation to mid-caps, for the high-return component and still keep risks in line. For aggressive investors, the Nifty Next 50 is a useful option to increase a portfolioâ€™s return potential without delving excessively into mid-caps and small-caps.

The Nifty 50 index lost 122.05 points or 1.08 per cent and ended at 11,178.40 last week.  The Friday session was not only unexpected, but also a difficult one, Singhvi added. On Friday, both Nifty and Bank Nifty traded in the range of 300 and 800 points, indicating high volatility in the markets.  Watch Zee Business Tweet Video Below: बाजार में शुक्रवार की गिरावट सरप्राइसिंग...अनिल सिंघवी ने कहा- ट्रेडर्स को बाजार में उतार-चढ़ाव के लिए तैयार रहना ही चाहिए, आज निचले स्तरों से आएगा सपोर्ट#EditorsTake #MarketUpdate #Nifty #BankNifty #NSE #BSE #Sensex #StockMarket @AnilSinghvi_ pic.twitter.com/YrO3DpRb8y — Zee Business (@ZeeBusiness) August 17, 2020 Many, including himself, did not expect a closing like this and he believed 11,200-11,225 level as a very strong support zone, the Managing Editor said. It is difficult to know the indicators on the last trading day of the week, he further said.   Advising investors not to worry, Singhvi said that such unexpected events sometime happen and the traders should be prepared to deal with them, he added.   The Market Guru said that the selling was not as much by funds (Foreign Institutional Investors) as has been seen in recent times. Singhvi said that on the last trading day, it appeared that the traders “threw” away their positions. He further said that it looked like they were waiting for a certain level of stop-loss, which got triggered once the Nifty went past 11,200 mark.  The breaching of the 11,200 level was a critical point, he added. While this support level was broken, the fact that the market did not come upward to this level even once was a decisive factor in Friday's closing, Singhvi said.  Singhvi explained that disciplined traders may have exited on strict stop-loss basis. In hindsight, it may look now that traders should have waited for some more time. But, the right strategy is to strictly follow the stop-loss. Things may work some time and at other times may not work. See Zee Business Live TV Streaming Below:  He said that the Put-Call ratio has decreased significantly, which is good. If the traders have reduced their positions, it augurs well for the markets.

The two indexes were set to finish lower for a third consecutive session, and over 0.3% lower for the week. Both indexes had risen over 0.5% each earlier in the session on expectations of more economic relief measures from the government, even as coronavirus cases continue to surge. (via Reuters) The Indian rupee on Friday ended lower at closing amid ongoing selling in the domestic equity market. While rupee opened flat at 74.85 per the US dollar, it closed at 74.90 per US dollar.   Indian benchmark indices have fallen sharply on account of weak overall sentiments. At 1:55 pm, Sensex was trading lower by 304.87 points at 38,005.62, while Nifty was trading 62 points lower at 11,238.05. The WPI inflation has fallen to 0.58 per cent in July, against 1.81 pc drop in June, accordng to official data released by the government.  Sensex and Nifty have been trading flat after a marginal gains in the morning. At 12:10 pm, Sensex was trading higher by over 100 points while Nifty was inching closer towards the 11,350-mark.  Gold prices continues to drop on Friday for the fifth consecutive session. Gold prices fell Rs 260 to Rs 52,670 after hitting an intraday high of Rs 52,700. MCX Gold futures are trading almost Rs 3,491 lower than the lifetime high of Rs 56,191 per 10 gram recorded last Friday. Silver futures were also trading lower by Rs 566 ay Rs 70,512 per kg today.    Jyoti Roy , DVP- Equity Strategist, Angel Broking: Tata Steel reported a 32.4% YoY degrowth in consolidated revenues to 24,288 crore for Q4FY20, as compared to revenues of 35,947 crore for Q4FY19. Sales volume for the quarter was down by 22.2% YoY to 4.93mn Tons while production was down by 28.1% YoY to 5.14mn Tons. EBIDTA for the quarter stood at 505.5 crore down 90.6% YoY while EBIDTA margins contracted by 12.9 percentage points 2.1%. Adjusted EBIDTA for the quarter was down by 81.2% YoY 1,038 crore. Consolidated net loss for the quarter stood at 4,648 crore as compared to profit of 714 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Though the company reported a greater than expected loss for the quarter it seems that the worst is over for the company as Global steel demand is expected to improve gradually from here on as economic activity recovers with relaxation in mobility restrictions and policy stimulus.  Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives, Angel Broking: Yesterday, we opened slightly higher in the wake of smart rally in global markets previous night. The lead extended marginally in the first half. But all of a sudden, the index dipped lower during the mid session. However the damage was not big as index recovered gradually and then slipped into a consolidation mode. Eventually, the weekly expiry panned out flat precisely at 11300. When it comes to index, the boredom continues for fourth straight day. But if we take a glance in the broader market, the picture is absolutely different. Mid and small cap stocks are just soaring in last few days. This is probably the best week for stocks from the broader market in the recent time, better than previous week as well. This is what we have been alluding to since last couple of days, when midcap universe starts to move, it just creates that euphoria as they tend to move as if there is no tomorrow.  Now talking about the benchmark, it is clearly struggling to surpass 11350-11400. In our sense, if Nifty doesn’t surpass the mentioned resistance zone, the possibility of it falling is quite high. In fact, if we look at the daily chart meticulously, we can see a formation of ‘Head and Shoulder’ pattern on daily chart and we are currently placed at the higher end of the right shoulder, which is the decisive one. Yes, it’s slightly early to comment on it as such pattern generally requires confirmation in the form of breaching the neckline (in this case, its around 11235-11175). Let see, in our sense, if any directional move has to happen in index, it will happen in next 1-2 days. We continue to remain cautious and advise traders to stay light. In fact with yesterday’s spectacular move, the NIFTY MIDCAP 50 has almost reached its strong resistance zone of weekly ‘200-SMA. So it’s important to take a note of this as well. Jyoti Roy , DVP- Equity Strategist, Angel Broking: BPCL reported a 49.2% YoY degrowth in standalone net sales of 38,785 crore for Q1FY21, due to fall in sales volume by 32.2% YoY to 7.53 million metric tons. EBIDTA for the quarter stood at 3,916 crore up by 79.6% YoY. Standalone net profit for the quarter was up by 93.1% YoY to 2,076 crore as compared to profit of 1,075 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Company reported GRM of USD 0.39 per bbl for the quarter as compared to USD 2.81 per bbl in Q1FY20. Sales were adversely impacted in the month of April and May due to the lockdowns though they have improved substantially by June. While the company posted a decent set of numbers for Q1FY21 we believe that there will be a durable improvement in demand only in the second half of FY21 while GRM’s will remain subdued in the near future. Shares of Eicher Motors slid over 2 per cent in early trade after the company reported a 66 per cent fall in total revenue from operations to Rs 818 crore in the quarter ended June. It also reported a loss of Rs 55 crore as against a profit of Rs 452 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.        Sensex and Nifty opened slightly higher on Friday amid mixed global cues.

READ MORE   Shares of pharmaceutical major Cipla surged over 9 per cent to touch nearly Rs 800 on the BSE on Monday. The surge in share price comes after the firm reported positive June quarter results on Friday.  Yash Gupta, Equity Research Associate, Angel Broking: Divi’s Laboratories reported an excellent set of numbers in Q1FY21. Consolidated revenue from operations for Q1FY21 stood at 1,730 crores up by 48.8% YoY from 1162.8 crores in Q1FY20.Gross margins stood at 63% in Q1FY21 up by 190 bps from 61.1% in Q1FY20.EBITDA up by 80.9% YoY to 700 Crores as compared to 387 Crores in Q1FY20. Due to increase in profit margins and saving in other expenses and employee cost.Profit after tax for the quarter stood at 492 Crore up by 80.% as compared to 272 Crore in Q1FY20. Company posted above expected set of numbers for the quarter. Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives, Angel Broking: The way markets are placed, this week would be quite crucial and hence, one should be keeping a close eye on few key levels. Although the market has managed to recover well, it would be a daunting task surpassing the sturdy wall of 11300-11350. Till the time it is not conquered successfully, we advocate some caution. Let’s understand, technically, why this should be considered an important junction. Firstly, the 78.6% retracement of the entire fall from 12430.50 to 7511.10 comes around it. Secondly, the 100% ‘Price Extension’ of the first up leg (7511.10 - 9889.05) from 8806.75 precisely coincides around 11300-11350. And now we are standing at the pullback level of the ‘Parabolic SAR’ which has been following the entire uptrend, has finally given some sign of weakness (due to Monday’s negative close) for the first time in the entire up move. Considering all these observations, we advise traders to stay light and should ideally take some money off the table. On the downside, a move below 11100would lead to immediate correction towards 10950 - 10880. Markets were on recovery mode first and then remained in a slender range of 150 points for three sessions. Looking at the benchmark index, it might appear a boring week (especially the second half); but if we meticulously observe the price action in the broader markets, we would rate it as one of the finest weeks for individual stocks in the last few weeks. Finally, on Friday, the NIFTY MIDCAP 50 index posted a smart rally to surpass its recent hurdles. Hence, traders are advised to stay focused on individual stocks in this week; but the aggressive positions should be avoided till the time important levels are not surpassed convincingly.  Both market benchmarks extended gains after starting off on a positive note in the morning. Sensex is trading higher by over 280 points while Nifty has crossed the 11,300-mark. As of now, Cipla and M&M are performing well with gains of over 8 per cent and 5 per cent respectively.  Shares of pharmaceutical major Cipla also gained 5 per cent after posting positive results in the first quarter of the current fiscal. Shares of Cipla are up nearly 5 per cent.   Shares of Mahindra and Mahindra gained in early trade on Monday despite reporting weak results for the quarter ended June.      At around 9:19 am, BSE Sense was trading 233.60 points or 0.61 per cent higher at 38,274.17, while NSE Nifty was inching closer to 11,300 after rising 0.65 per cent in early trade.  Several defence-related stocks such as L&T, BEL and Bharat Forge may see upward movement on Monday after the defence ministry announced over the weekend that it has prepared a list of 101 items for which there would be an embargo on the import beyond the timeline indicated against them. Read full story Oil prices have climbed in early trade on Monday, recovering over half of Friday's losses on hopes for a stimulus deal to shore up the US economic recovery and also due to a pledge from Iraq to deepen its crude oil supply cuts, reported news agency Reuters.  Asian shares on Monday started off proceedings cautiously as investors remain worried about flaring tensions between the United States and China. Uncertainty over US fiscal stimulus has also kept global markets on the edge. While Japanese and Singaporean markets are closed for public holidays, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan stayed below a peak of 6-1/2 months. A slower start for Asian markets indicates that domestic markets will open weaker. It may be noted that while global equities have rebounded since hitting a rock bottom in March, rising coronavirus cases and deaths in many countries have dented investor sentiments sharply.

The RBI's decision of keeping rates unchanged could have been influenced by the CPI inflation which came in at 6.09% for the month of June and is above the RBI’s upper threshold of 6%. While further rate cuts by the RBI will be dependent on inflation coming down current levels, we expect the RBI will try to ensure adequate credit flow to the economy along with taking steps to ensure full transmission of the 250 bps rate cuts done so far.

Strong revenue/EBITDA/PAT growth of 13%/38%/42% respectively led by strong growth in India Foods and International Beverages. Despite the production and supply chain disruptions in April, superb on-ground execution helped further by pantry stocking led to 8% growth in India tea, 19% in India foods (11% in salt and >50% in pulses/spices), 15% in international beverages (13% in tea and 37% in EOC coffee) and 12% in Tata Coffee. Strong 310bps EBITDA margin improvement to 17.9% led by better realizations, lower trade spends, better product and channel mix, utilization of low priced RM inventory and lower discretionary expenditure across key cost heads.

freefincalICICI Prudential Alpha Low Vol 30 ETF Review: What you need to knowIt is a two-factor exchange-traded fund that aims to provide returns closely corresponding to the returns provided by Nifty Alpha Low-Volatility 30 Index..4 Aug 2020,https://freefincal.com/icici-prudential-alpha-low-vol-30-etf-review-what-you-need-to-know/,4 Aug 2020,ICICI Prudential Alpha Low Vol 30 ETF Review: What you need to know,"Home ⇒ mutual fund reviews ⇒ ICICI Prudential Alpha Low Vol 30 ETF Review: What you need to know Published: August 4, 2020 at 11:37 am Last Updated on December 29, 2021 at 5:40 pm ICICI Prudential Alpha Low Vol 30 ETF currently in its NFO period (Aug 3 to Aug 10) will be the first: “multi-factor” ETF in India. When investors hear the word “alpha” it starts all kinds of bells and whistles inside them. This is because of an incorrect understanding of what alpha actually is. Here is why one should get too excited over this ETF. What is ICICI Prudential Alpha Low Vol 30 ETF: It is a two-factor exchange-traded fund that aims to provide returns closely corresponding to the returns provided by Nifty Alpha Low-Volatility 30 Index, subject to tracking error. What is Nifty Alpha Low-Volatility 30 Index? It is a 30 stock index selected from NIFTY 100 and NIFTY Midcap 50 based on 50% Jensen’s alpha and 50% low volatility. The index weight is capped at 5%. What is alpha?  Alpha is not an excess return! Alpha is excess return calculated on a risk-adjusted basis. There is a big difference! Alpha is a measure of risk-adjusted outperformance with respect to NIfty 50 and the MIBOR* 3-month bond rate representing the risk-free return. MIBOR = Mumbai Interbank Offered Rate (a benchmark rate for one bank to lend to another), Read more: What is Alpha of a fund/stock? It is NOT excess return above the market! Alpha factors in how volatile a fund has been compared to the market. A stock/fund that beats the market but is more volatile than the market in doing so will have lower alpha than a fund with lower volatility. Thus even funds with no excess returns can “produce an alpha”. The presentation for ICICI Prudential Alpha Low Vol 30 ETF  says, ALPHA: Excess Returns over the normal returns. This is misleading. What is low volatility? It is defined as the “Standard deviation of daily price returns” over the last year.  Also see: Watch my talk on momentum and low volatility stock investing in India What is a factor-based index? An index created by active stock selection using conditions such as low volatility, momentum, alpha, quality, value etc. and not market capitalization is called a factor index. Stocks in the index are weighted using these factors – for eg. lower volatility stock has a higher weight. So this combines active stock-picking – quantitative, rule-based -with passive investing (if an ETF or index fund follows this index). What the factor-based funds available in India? A full list is available here: List of factor-based ETFs & index funds (smart beta) in India. It may be of interest to note that ICICI already have a low volatility ETF with 111+ crores, a Value ETF with 7+ crores. If you are wondering what they hope to gain from this, then it is institutional investors and fund of funds (primarily their own). They are one of the first fund houses to have appreciated a change in tax rule. Now a fund of fund investing only in Indian equity ETFs is also an equity fund. So you can expect the ICICI Prudential Alpha Low Vol 30 ETF  to be soon found in their existing and new fund of funds (equity/non-equity). Start a “low cost” ETF, start a fund of fund, offer good commissions and drive retail AUM into it. What is a multi-factor index? This is an index constructed with two or more factors or rules. For example, there are four multi-factor indices launched by the NSE: 1. NIFTY Alpha Low-Volatility 30 = 50% alpha + 50% low volatility. 2. NIFTY Quality Low-Volatility 30 = 50% quality + 50% low volatility. 3. NIFTY Alpha Quality Low-Volatility 30 = 1/3 Alpha + 1/3 Quality + 1/3 Low Vol. 4. NIFTY Alpha Quality Value Low-Volatility 30 = 25% Alpha + 25% Quality + 25% Value + 25%Low Volatility. For more details on each of these indices see: How new stock investors can quickly start investing using NIFTY Multi-Factor Indices. Also see: Overview of indices and index investing in India (Youtube video) What is the benefit of a factor-index? Unlike a market-cap based index, a factor-index often (not always) has a weighting cap of, for example, 5%. This lowers concentration risk. Depending on the rule used, a factor-based index can from time to time (not always) offer lower risk and/or higher returns than a market-cap based index. However, much of this “performance” is based on a backtest and not actual traded history. Also, as we shall see in this article, the general public does not have access to all permutations and combinations of factors used. Therefore we can never objectively decide if the particular set of rules used for an index is the only possible set or if anything else would have worked just as well. Read more: Data Mining in Index Construction: Why Investors need to be cautious What is the benefit of a multi-factor index? This provides diversification in the rules. When an index house or fund house projects a single factor index or ETF, they would tell you “why a single-factor is better than a usual index”. They would leave out the fact that a single factor may not work all the time or can be riskier.  When they a project a multi-factor index or ETF they would go “Multi-factors counters the impact of the cyclicality of single-factor indices”. This means factor X works on somedays, factor Y on some other days. So we are hoping X + Y would be better.  The problem is, we can never objectively find out if X+Y is better than X or Y. Take for example the underlying index of this ETF: Nifty Alpha Low-Volatility 30 Index This picks 30 stocks from NIFTY 100 and NIFTY Midcap 50. That is  30 from the top 150 NSE stocks in terms of market cap. Now to access the benefit of combining alpha and low volatility, we should compare this with an alpha index of 30 stocks and a low volatility 30 stock index both chosen from the same 150 stock universe. This simple urge driven by commonsense cannot be satisfied and both the index house and fund house will not do this comparison either.  The NSE offers NIFTY Alpha 50, which is 50 stocks from the top 300 stocks by market cap. It also NIFTY Low Volatility 50 which is 50 picked from the top 300 stocks by market cap. Now when you want to combine alpha and low volatility the logical choice would be to just combine these two indices. The NSE instead creates the factor-index by halving the 300 stock universe to 150. Why did they do this? Why not choose from the top 300? Why offer a low volatility 50/300 index when there is a low volatility 30/100 index (ICICI has an ETF on this)? We will never know. This may or may not be an act of data mining but it certainly makes someone driven by a sense rigour and logic uncomfortable. Both fund and index houses know that such people are an insignificant minority. In July 2017 the NSE published a whitepaper on multi-factor indices in which it conceded “Low-Volatility index strategy has remained one of best-performing strategies over long term period”. They also pointed out that “alpha” outperformance strongly depends on bull runs. So intuitively combining alpha + low volatility will make things worse for an investor preferring low volatility and make things better for an investor chasing after alpha. “Make things better/worse” here refers to decrease or increase in the spread of rolling returns. When the price movement is shown since inception like this, it is enough to get anyone excited. You can immediately see why ICIC chose this multi-factor index. It has all the right words – alpha, low volatility –  in it and the since inception growth to boot.  The Nifty Alpha Low-Volatility 30 Index was launched only on July 10th 2017. So much of the data below is a backtest. So returns are are a backtest of a backtest! Shown below is the five-year rolling return and standard deviation for the various indices mentioned above. Notice “alpha” is the most volatile (spread bet max and min return), more than the NIfty. The low volatility indices swing the least. When alpha is added with low volatility and the stock universe reduced by 50%, the spread is significantly lowered with more returns than the low volatility index during bull runs. The rolling standard deviation over five years shows how volatile “alpha” alone is. The ten-year rolling returns are shown below and inferences similar to the 5-year data above can be made but the sample set has significantly reduced. Please do not conclude based on this alpha + low volatility is better than low volatility. We need more history. The 15-year rolling return data tells how woefully short the sample size is. Notice the 15-year investments were made only bet Jan 2004 and Aug 2005 – a very short time frame and this is for the low vol 50 and alpha 50 indices. The alpha + low vol index has just 89 data points as indicated in the figure below. To conclude, the alpha + low volatility index is likely to outperform the alpha based index most of the time (except perhaps during extreme bull runs). The same may not be true with respect to low volatility. We need more data. Should one consider investing in ICICI Prudential Alpha Low Vol 30 ETF?  Not unless you can buy and sell directly with the AMC. As on date, all such factor-based funds or smart-beta funds have very low AUM and little interest among investors. So do not buy a few units of this ETF from time to time and get in trouble trying to sell when you need the money. This is meant for institutional investors and fund of funds. As of now, the only benefit from such an ETF is, they now have a monthly source (the fund factsheet) for the full portfolio of the Nifty Alpha Low-Volatility 30 Index.

""Avoid aggressive longs unless Nifty takes out the 11,300-11,350 zone on a closing basis. Until that happens, we will find the index vulnerable at higher levels. A highly focused and stock-specific approach is advised for the day,"" said Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA is a Consultant Technical Analyst and founder of Gemstone Equity Research & Advisory Services. This counter appears to be consolidating in the zone of Rs 650-568 levels for the last 39 sessions. It can be on the verge of a consolidation breakout as volumes are relatively higher on the way up after testing the lower end of the consolidation zone. Moreover, on the weekly Line chart (closing price chart) it appears to have already registered a breakout above the consolidation zone. Hence, positional traders are advised to buy into this counter in anticipation of a strong breakout with a close above Rs 650 levels. In that scenario, a bigger target of Rs 697 can be expected. Stop suggested for the trade is close below Rs 600. (Analyst: Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in) This counter appears to have registered a decisive breakout above its critical resistance point placed around Rs 510 levels on much higher volumes. Hence, sustaining above Rs 507 levels much bigger targets can be expected. However, as technical stop loss levels are somewhat far away positional traders are advised to adopt a two-pronged strategy of buying now and adding further on correction if any into the zone of Rs 516-511 and look for a target of Rs 590. Stop suggested for the trade is close below Rs 506. (Analyst: Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in)      For the last 4 trading sessions, this counter appears to be moving almost flat with similar closes around Rs 190 levels. Hence, sustaining above Rs 186 levels, it can initially test its critical near-term resistance point of Rs 202 levels. However, a strong sustainable close above Rs 202 can open much bigger targets of Rs 219. For time being, traders can buy into this counter with a stop below Rs 186 on closing basis for targets of Rs 219. (Analyst: Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in)  The stock price has broken out from the consolidation, which was there for the last 10 trading sessions. The stock has been on a primary uptrend with higher tops and higher bottoms on the daily and weekly charts. Derivative Data also suggest long build up in the counter. Traders can buy the stock with a target price of Rs 760 and a stop loss at Rs 695. (Analyst: Vinay Rajani, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC securities)  The stock has formed a strong base around Rs 664 and reversed north. The stock went up more than 1.5% with rising volumes on 31st July 2020. It is now on the verge of giving breakout from the downward sloping channel on the daily charts. Indicators and oscillators have turned bullish on the hourly and daily charts. Traders can buy this stock with a target price of Rs 735 and a stop loss at Rs 670. (Analyst: Vinay Rajani, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC securities)  The stock has rallied nearly 20% in the last month. Recently, it made fresh all time high of Rs 1,112 and post the sharp price surge, it closed above Rs 1065 resistance mark, which is broadly positive. The modest volume activity post breakout clearly indicates high chances of the further uptrend from current levels. On the daily and weekly charts, the stock has formed a strong promising price volume breakout formation that indicates bulls are clearly dominating the price action. For the breakout traders, Rs 1,045 should be the key levels to watch; the overall chart structure suggests that if the stock sustains above the same then breakout continuation texture likely to continue up to Rs 1,170. Stop suggested for the trade is at Rs 1,045. (Analyst: Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research at Kotak Securities)  From the last few weeks, the stock has been hovering in the range of Rs 345 to Rs 385 zone. But on Friday, Cadila not only surpassed Rs 385 resistance mark but after a long time managed to close above the same which is grossly positive. On daily and weekly charts, the stock has formed strong price volume breakout formation which suggests high chances of further uptrend from current levels. In addition, strong Bar Reversal candle on weekly charts along with incremental volume activity clearly indicate the breakout continuation texture is likely to continue in the near term. For the swing traders, Rs 375 should be the sacrosanct level. Trading above the same, we can expect uptrend continuation wave up to Rs 420. Stop loss suggested for the trade at Rs 375. (Analyst: Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research at Kotak Securities)  The stock has been consistently forming higher bottom series formation. The series of higher bottom formation suggest stock is in a strong uptrend and this wave is likely to continue in the near term. Post strong uptrend rally from Rs 2700 to Rs 3150, the stock is witnessing minor profit booking near Rs 3,150 level. However, the medium term texture of the Bajaj Auto is robust and any meaningful correction should be the opportunity for traders to add long positions near support levels. In addition, currently the stock is hovering near 200-day SMA and trading near important retracement level of Rs 2,947. Unless it trading below Rs 2,870, positional traders can retain an optimistic stance and look for a target Rs 3,230. Fresh buying can be considered now and on dips, if any, between Rs 3,000-2,947 levels with a stop loss below Rs 2,870. (Analyst: Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research at Kotak Securities) On the daily chart, the stock prices after oscillating around the 200 SMA between Rs 840-920 levels for the last few weeks have finally given a bullish range breakout. That said, the breakout is supported by a bullish candlestick pattern and an increase in volume. In addition, we are witnessing a bullish crossover between two key averages i.e. 50SMA crossing 89EMA from below. Moreover, prices have also closed above the higher band of Bollinger band indicating an up move after the recent consolidation phase. Hence, we recommend a buy on the stock at current levels for a target of Rs 980 over the next 14 sessions. The stop loss should be fixed below Rs 894. (Analyst: Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst Technical and Derivatives at Angel Broking)  The pharma stocks are buzzing for their strong outperformance and this stock as well is in a strong uptrend, continuously moving in a ‘Higher Top Higher Bottom’ price formation. For the last few sessions, the prices were consolidating around the April month high of Rs 1,825 and finally they have broken above the resistance, confirming a continuation ‘SAUCER’ pattern breakout. Prices are now trading in uncharted territory and after the recent consolidation, we sense a fresh leg of upside in the near term. Going with the sector as well as stock analysis, we expect a strong outperformance by this counter. Hence, we recommend a buy on this stock at current levels for a target of Rs 2,100 over the next 14 sessions. The stop loss should be fixed at Rs 1,749. (Analyst: Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst Technical and Derivatives at Angel Broking)  The stock has once again made a good support base near Rs 340 levels and is currently indicating a trend reversal after a decent correction. The RSI has shown a trend reversal to signal a buy. The analyst suggests to buy and accumulate the stock for an upside positional target of Rs 380-390, keeping the stop loss near Rs 335. (Analyst: Vaishali Parekh, Senior Technical Analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher) The stock has been maintaining a strong base near Rs 90 levels and currently has started picking momentum to indicate a positive bias. It has got the strength and potential to rise further upward in the coming days. The RSI also has indicated a trend reversal to signal a buy and with the chart looking attractive, the analyst suggests to buy and accumulate this stock for an upside target of Rs 110-118 keeping the stop loss of Rs 90.

"The Indian WireNifty Update: Zee, GAIL, Bharti Infratel May Be Dropped From Nifty In the Next Review.Currently on the basis of float market capitalization and other criteria, HDFC Life Insurance, SBI Life Insurance, Divis Labs, and Dabur India are expected....1 Aug 2020",https://www.theindianwire.com/business/nifty-update-zee-gail-bharti-infratel-may-be-dropped-from-nifty-in-the-next-review-280232/,1 Aug 2020,"Nifty Update: Zee, GAIL, Bharti Infratel May Be Dropped From Nifty In the Next Review. - The Indian Wire","The norms for including and excluding stocks from the Index 1. The criteria for inclusion in the Nifty 50  The stock in the last six months should have traded at an average impact cost of 0.5% or less for 90% of the observations
 Should also have at least 1.5x of the float-adjusted market capitalization of the current smallest index constituent.
 The company must be domiciled in India and traded on the exchange.
 In order to include a stock into an index, the stock must be available for trading in the F & O segment on the NSE
 The other criteria that are considered for including a stock into an index are Market capitalization, liquidity, and trading frequency. Currently, HDFC Life Insurance, SBI Life Insurance, Divis Labs and Dabur India are expected to be included in the Nifty 50 Index, as they fulfil above-mentioned criteria.
In the last 6 months when Nifty posted a loss of 9%, Divis Lab has posted a return of 39% while Dabur has been giving gains of 7.3%, and HDFC Life grew by 32% 2. What leads to exclusion from the index? A list of new eligible stocks is drawn twice a year, to review against the current index constituents and in case any changes are to be made, new stocks replace the smallest constituents are excluded. Exclusion may also happen in case of a spin-off, merger or acquisition. GAIL (India), Bharti Infratel and Zee Entertainment have lost 5 percent to 52 per
cent in the last 6 months. 3. When do the changes take place? The index is re-balanced twice a year and before making any changes to the index, the ex-change gives four weeks time. 4. Who decides which company will be a part of the benchmark Index?  67 indices under Nifty brand, including the Nifty index, is owned and managed by The India Index Services and Products, a group company of the National Stock Exchange of India.
 Index Maintenance Subcommittee set up by IISL makes all decisions on inclusions and exclusions in the index. 5. Does the index level, with the changes made in the Index? No. When a stock is replaced by another stock in the index, the index divisor is adjusted so the change in index market value that results from the inclusion and exclusion does not change the index level. aspiring entrepreneur and financial market enthusiast with a zeal to learn and get better with each passing day Your email address will not be published.

That principle applies to trading in the stock markets....29 Jul 2020",https://upstox.com/market-talk/four-ways-to-predict-market-performance-effectively/,29 Jul 2020,Four ways to predict market performance effectively - Upstox,"There is a popular saying among car racers, “You cannot drive with one eye on the rear-view mirror”. That principle applies to trading in the stock markets too. You need to take lessons from past experience but focus on estimating what will happen in the future. As Buffett himself put it, “If the past is all that mattered, then archaeologists would be the wealthiest persons in the world today”. The only way to be able to profit in trading is by estimating the future with a reasonable degree of accuracy. This applies to all asset classes, not just to equities alone. Let us see how to go about predicting the performance of the market in general and stocks in particular. You are up against supercomputers, so break that matrix Are you wondering what this means? If you have traded in the markets, you would have surely experienced this. It is estimated that 80-85% of the traders tend to lose money in intraday trading, and that is hardly surprising because you are up against machines that are incredibly fast and can consider a multitude of permutations and combinations which the human mind may take too long. It is not just about algo trading and high frequency trading (HFT). It is also about the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning, where computers are trained to think like humans and act like computers. The only way for you to make money in this kind of a market is to break that matrix. How do you do it? There are 3 ways to break this matrix. Firstly, focus on quality stocks for the long term, where you don’t need to compete with the Deep Blue. Invest in training and skill building as that can get you better results in trading. Lastly, try to estimate value and not the price. After all, price is what you pay, and value is what you get. Learn from the champs; surely, they know something you don’t What is this smart money all about? Typically, it is the institutional investors who work at investment banks, mutual funds and hedge funds. Since the smart money is analysing the same data and following the same indicators, a smart money herd mentality is created. The internet allows outsiders to get a glimpse of that mentality—to predict what the smart money is doing and what position it may take on a certain asset. You don’t need to jump in and start buying what institutions are buying. In fact, you shouldn’t do that because their risk appetite and perspective is very different. Instead, you must focus on two important predictors in the market. At a macro level, do a comparison of market cap / GDP of the Indian markets with global markets. Secondly, at a micro level, use price-to-earnings-growth (PEG) ratio to shortlist stocks. The PEG captures undervaluation with reference to growth and hence is extremely authentic and credible in the Indian context. Start off by taking a macro view first If you want to form a market view, it is best to begin with a world view or a macro level view. A bottom-up approach really does not work unless you are an institutional investor with corporate access. In the Indian context, there are 3 indicators that are very critical for a macro view. Focus on a combination of the PMI Manufacturing and PMI Services. For a sustained stock market up move, both the indicators must be above 50 with positive momentum. The second indicator is inflation because it influences interest rates and the cost of funds. That directly hits corporate balance sheets and solvency. Lower the inflation, the better it is. Lastly, look at the country’s fiscal deficit. In the Indian context, fiscal deficit within the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) limits is always the preferred option. Market upsides at a macro level are more sustainable when the fiscal deficit is within the FRBM limits. Time to answer 3 key questions Retail investors should always predict markets on the basis of macros. Of the 3 factors highlighted above, give the highest weightage to high growth and low inflation followed by fiscal deficit. Once you do that, just look at the sectors that could benefit. For example, capital goods benefits from GDP growth, FMCG from consumption led growth, banks from low inflation etc. Finally, focus on the companies with consistent sales and profit growth for the last 5 years. If you do this consistently, you have a greater chance of predicting the market effectively.  RELATED ARTICLES 30th Floor, Sunshine Tower, Senapati Bapat Marg, Dadar (W), Mumbai, Maharashtra 400013 Products Company Services Social Popular Stocks Indian Stocks Calculators Demat Account Guide Trading Account Guide Online Trading Guide Intraday Trading Guide Futures and Options Guide Mutual Funds Guide Share Market Guide IPO Guide Stock Broker Guide More Banking Saving Account Saving Schemes IPO Learn F&O – Learning Popular Stocks Indian Stocks Calculators Demat Account Guide Trading Account Guide Online Trading Guide Intraday Trading Guide Futures and Options Guide Mutual Funds Guide Share Market Guide IPO Guide Stock Broker Guide More Banking Saving Account Saving Schemes IPO Learn F&O – Learning Made with ❤️ in India | Copyright © 2024, Upstox

 Financial Planning Made Simple The NIFTY 50 is a benchmark Indian stock market index that represents the weighted average of 50 of the largest Indian companies by free float market capitalization listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) Nifty 50 stocks with index weightage and market capitalization is mentioned in below table for April 30th 2021. These 50 out of the 1600 companies traded on the NSE representing 65% its free float market capitalization. The Nifty 50 index started trading in April 1996. Reliance is consistently leading with  ~10% weightage and is clearly one of  the biggest Index mover. It is also now the undisputed largest company in India with TCS being the distant number two. Reliance is marked as Oil & Gas sector company even though its major market valuation is due to its Telecom & Retail business.     In March’21 , Tata Consumer Products  Ltd was added in the index in place of GAIL (India) Ltd. Here is the latest (April 30th, 2021) Nifty 50 Sector allocation which shows Financial sector is still leading the allocation with HDFC Bank, HDFC Ltd, Kotak Mahindra Bank & ICICI Bank being part of top 10 market cap companies in India. Information Technology (IT) sector has second largest allocation after financials due to stellar performance of IT giants like TCS and Infosys. Reliance Industries weightage in NIFTY 50 is same , however it is declining over past few months in a row, which led to Oil & Gas sector slipping to third position from second position (in Sept’20) in terms of sector allocation.   Market cap of Indusind Bak is incorrect. Good article How does the weight of companies change? They change as the price of the stock changes Now it is understood the movement of Nifty is seen upward due to four major constituents Financial, It Consumer Goods and It are constituting more than 70%  hence this is the main reason I got a clarity from this post on company weightage on Nifty50 index. Sir, How can i free float shares details historically of Nifty 50 companies? This site uses Akismet to reduce spam. Learn how your comment data is processed.

Since 1 April this year, the Nifty 50 gained 29.48% to hold the 11000-mark. The Nifty Mid-Cap 100 and the Nifty Small-Cap 100 have gained 31.78% and 37.08%, respectively. Mint probes the phenomenon. What are the factors driving the markets? Global central banks have unleashed massive amounts of liquidity to tide through the crisis since March. Some of that liquidity is finding its way into the equity markets. This has seen global and domestic markets post sharp gains. Over the past several months, foreign investors have been purchasing equity along with domestic and high-net worth investors. Retail investors have also stepped up their participation in equity market. Retail turnover has increased to about 57% of the average cash volumes on the exchanges in the first quarter FY21, according to brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services. What is pushing retail investors to equities? Interest rates on fixed deposits and other fixed-income instruments have been sliding. This has reduced yields in the hands of investors. Besides, investors are reasoning that stock prices have been beaten down because of the market meltdown in March. The imperative of working from home has given investors time to explore equity as an investment. Further, technology has allowed investors to join various trading platforms because of the online KYC norms. Online tools and mobile apps have mushroomed, making it easier for people to invest in stocks. Internet and mobile-based trading made up nearly 37% of cash trades in June. What is the rate of retail investors’ participation? Retail investor turnover on the bourses has sharply increased even as overall cash volumes have swelled. Retail investor turnover in the first quarter of the current fiscal has shot up 78% from the year-ago period to  ₹33,731 crore in the cash segment. The number of demat accounts have also jumped by 2.9 million from January this year till May. Which retail segments are investors targeting? Retail investors have been participating across the valuation spectrum, but there has also been an increase in participation in the mid- and small-cap segments. The overall turnover is rising, but volumes in mid- and small-cap segments have recently increased to a considerable extent. Retail investors tend to participate in a big way in small- and mid-cap segments. The small- and mid-cap indices lagged the broader market last year, but so far in FY21 both these indices are outperforming the broader market. Will retail flows sustain market performance? Data has shown that investors enter the market when it tends to peak. This time, however, retail flows and market performance have been strong, suggesting that investors have played some role in recovery since March. Brokerages note that when retail flows are strong, stocks turn negative in ensuing months. Many investors are entering the markets in recent months after the market has risen from its March lows. Many stocks have also seen increases in the past few months, with elevated returns. This could lead to reduced returns.

Read More We’re not surprised by the fall as markets were signaling exhaustion at the higher levels. Indications are in the favour of a further decline and Nifty could test 10,500 levels. Though the global markets are still buoyant, rising cases in India have raised fears of the imposition of lockdown in certain parts, which could dent the pace of recovery. We advise continuing with the stock-specific trading approach and accumulating defensive on dips. Nifty index opened gap down in line with the weakness in Global market and drifted towards 10550 zones. It formed a Bearish candle on daily scale and corrected by more than 200 points. It has broken its rising support trend line by connecting all the recent swing low of 7511, 9004, 9544, 9845, 10250, 10300 and 10700 zones. It has also given a consolidation break down by holding below its previous weekly support of 10650 zones. Mechanical indicator RSI has given a negative crossover and showing a sign of profit booking decline. Now, till it holds below 10700 zones, weakness could be seen towards 10500-10450 zones while immediate hurdle exists at 10750 then 10850 zones. : Indian benchmark equity indices had their biggest single-day drop since early-June, tracking weakness in Asian peers. The NSE Nifty 50 index ended 1.79% lower at 10,609. Technically, Nifty has shown weakness after a long time. On downmoves, it could take support at 10484. The markets exhibited high correlation with the global markets and with the virus infections hitting day highs in India, the uncertainty caught up with the markets. Global markets were weak following rising infections in US and US-China tensions being back in the news. Indian markets were also worried about the increasing number of localized lockdowns which would in turn again slowdown the predicted recovery for businesses. Volatility is expected to remain and investors are advised to be cautious and be stock specific in their trades. The Nifty broke the level of 10650 on a closing basis. This could result in some downward movement. We could expect 10480-10500 as the next level of support and thereafter 10350. On the upside, in order to resume its uptrend, the markets would need to go past 10750 on a closing basis. Dalal Street corrected close to 2% behind weakness in financials and metal stocks. Despite the two Telecom Majors holding firm ahead of key events, we witnessed profit booking in key auto stocks as their volume numbers are anyways known to the street for the first quarter. : Benchmark indices on July 14 witnessed profit booking which dragged Nifty below 10650 level on the back of selling pressure seen in the auto, bank and metal stocks.

Pandemic events such as Covid-19 are “black swan” events as they cannot be predicted, and no diversification strategy can protect an investment from these kinds of systemic risks. As the pundits say, “diversification will fail you when you need the most”. In events such as the financial crisis in 2008 or the Covid-19 pandemic which we are facing now, even a well-diversified portfolio will lose money. So how do you protect your wealth when the market crashes during such events but also participate in the upside and get the best of both worlds without losing out on your financial goals. The answer is to have an “insurance” or “safe net” sort of strategy when building your portfolio. Once such “safe net” strategy is the Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (CPPI). Even though these kind of strategies are being used in the industry in many forms and techniques, here we attempt to look through a step-by-step, Data science methodology of Extracting adequate data from relevant sources, Cleaning, Transforming and Modelling them, implementing an on-the-fly CPPI algorithm, arriving at the back test results and interactively analyse the strategy using advanced data visualization methods. In the next few sections, we discuss more on the balance between user interactivity, intuitiveness and algorithmic complexity of the CPPI calculation rather than the nitty gritty of the CPPI as a Portfolio strategy. For more details on how CPPI works and a layman example of what it is, have a look at https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cppi.asp. We use Python/Anaconda for Data Engineering & Algorithms, Tableau for Data visualization and the analytics extension library- TabPy — as the technological tools for the solution. Primary data source for our study is the NSE India website and we attempted to use web crawling to extract historical prices of the NIFTY-50 stocks. Then we found a very useful Library/API ‘NSEPY’ which does it in a more graceful manner of extracting historical prices given a stock symbol. So, we first created a list of the 50 stocks and called the NSEpy library/api (https://github.com/swapniljariwala/nsepy/tree/master/nsepy) to extract data from Jan-2018 till Jun-2020. Raw data extracted from NSE will look like the following: These data points are basically various price points on a given day for an equity. Handling daily frequency data for a portfolio analysis may be an overkill and for the sake of simplicity we will aggregate the data at a weekly level. From the daily prices, we will find the weekly price points like open, close, high and low. We should also be careful about the column headings and make sure they look clean without any spaces or special characters in between. Once you convert to weekly time series data, the data frame should like like below: After this weekly grouping, calculate the weekly returns which is the percentage change of price from the previous week. A visual representation of the above data frame should look like the following figure in Tableau or for that matter any Data visualization tools. As we can see the weekly returns were very busy during the Feb-May 2020 time frame resulting in lot of volatility. In this section we will see a pseudo-code of how to implement the CPPI algorithm in Python. There are basically less than a handful of steps to implement it and not complicated to implement in python. For a given set of time-series data of weekly returns, we need to traverse as many steps to compute and store the various indicators for each point in time. Initialize and setup the CPPI Parameters # set up the CPPI parameters n_steps = len(weekly returns dataset) account_value = start (start value of your investment) floor_value = start*floor (floor is an input parameter, typically between 0.1–1.0) peak = account_value Then, for each step in the time series of weekly returns, calculate the following steps Step1: cushion = (account_value — floor_value)/account_value Step2: Calculate risky weight and safe weight: risky_weight = m * cushion (m is an input parameter, a multiplier which basically indicates the investor’s risk profile and a value standardized to fall between 0–1) safe_weight = 1 — risky_weight risky_allocation = account_value*risky_weight safe_allocation = account_value*safe_weight Step3: Recompute the account value account_value = risky_allocation*(1+risky_weekly_return) + safe_allocation*(1+safe_weekly_return) where risky_weekly_return is the time series weekly return of an equity received as input and safe_weekly_return is typically calculated with an assumed risk free interest rate of a safe net product like treasury bond. Step4: Compute the risky wealth using a cumulative product method as for each time slot the returns need to be compounded. risky_wealth = start*(1+risky_r[step])*risky_wealth_prev risky_wealth_prev = (1+risky_r[step])*risky_wealth_prev Step5: Store all the indicators in a back-test container for each time period. Now that we have the CPPI algorithm in place, let us pick a few stocks which returned higher annual returns and a few stocks which were highly volatile and observe the back-test results of the CPPI strategy. We can easily observe that volatility is not good for performance, and it is evident that high performance stocks (high annual return) have low volatility and vice-versa. Nestle India the top performing stock between Jan-2018 and Jun-2020 returns a terminal wealth of 1522.36 for a 1000 rupees initial investment using the CPPI strategy. If we would have invested all the 1000 rupees without any strategy, we would have ended up with 2119 rupees. Obviously, we are losing out by following a CPPI strategy when the going is good. But the advantage of a CPPI strategy is when a black swan occurs and when the going is not good. When we observe GAIL, which is the poorest performing stock, we will be able to appreciate the benefits of the strategy. As we can see, if we didn’t implement the CPPI strategy and invested all our money in the risky account, we would have ended up at a terminal value of 210.4 rupees for an initial investment of 1000 rupees. It would have shattered the financial goals of the investor, isn’t it?. On the contrary, if we have followed the CPPI strategy, our loss would not go below the floor value which we have set up earlier and we would have ended up with 807.62 rupees thus protecting our financial goals reducing the losses to a great extent and protecting the capital. There are other limitations of the CPPI strategy because of the rebalancing we must do, which in turn can increase the transaction costs which has to be factored in. Tableau provides an analytic extension to Python called Tabpy which is useful tool to integrate the data engineering & algorithmic tasks in python with advanced visualization ability in Tableau. One can easily deploy the python CPPI algorithm as follows in Jupyter client.deploy(‘run_cppi’, run_cppi, ‘Run a back test of the CPPIstrategy, given a set of returns for the risky asset’ ,override = True) In Tableau the endpoint’s return values are received in the form of a calculated field, as follows: SCRIPT_STR(“return tabpy.query(‘run_cppi’,_arg1,_arg2,_arg3,_arg4,_arg5)[‘response’]”,SUM([Weekly_Return]),cppi_m,cppi_start,cppi_floor,cppi_rfrate) ##def run_cppi(risky_r, m=3, start=1000, floor=0.8, riskfree_rate=0.03): Even though Tableau and Python are used extensively in Financial services firms, the ability to integrate them and use them to their respective strengths, provides the “speed of thought” analytical ability which is not possible only with either of these tools. The analytical extension has provided data scientists to design and implement solutions which could be very useful to advise on investment strategies such as CPPI. Even though the implementation of this solution is not without hacks and workarounds, we will save it for another time to discuss.

"A Wealth of Common SenseThe Nifty Fifty and the Old NormalThese blue chip stocks with high growth characteristics became known as the Nifty Fifty and included the likes of Polaroid, Xerox, McDonald's, Coca-Cola, IBM....2 Jul 2020",https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2020/07/the-nifty-fifty-and-the-old-normal/,2 Jul 2020,The Nifty Fifty and the Old Normal - A Wealth of Common Sense,"A Wealth of Common Sense Posted July 2, 2020 by Ben Carlson A podcast listener asks: About mid-to-late 2019 I said f*ck it and put most of my portfolio into Facebook, Apple and Microsoft and have done really well. Why shouldn’t I put every penny into these stocks (along with Amazon, Netflix and Google) and just wait for other businesses to get closer to them? I can’t help but be curious about names like SHOP (Shopify) and SPOT (Spotify) and eventually the Airbnb IPO. But there’s still a huge part of me that says the FANMAG is it. Change my mind. I get the sentiment here. It’s hard to ignore how wonderful both the businesses and stocks of companies like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, Apple and Google have performed. Look at how well these stocks have done over the past 10 years in comparison to the S&P 500: These numbers are amazing. And with the kind of growth you get from these companies, investors are willing to pay a premium: This is a situation where we have: This is not the first time investors have become enamored with name-brand growth stocks. There was a nasty bear market from 1968-1970 which saw the S&P 500 fall 36% but smaller and value stocks get hit even harder. So investors came out of that downturn more enamored with bigger, growth-oriented companies. These blue chip stocks with high growth characteristics became known as the Nifty Fifty and included the likes of Polaroid, Xerox, McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, IBM and JC Penney. The average price-to-earnings of the Nifty Fifty was 42x, more than double the 19x P/E ratio for the S&P 500 at large. More than 20% of these companies had P/E ratios in excess of 50x earnings by the end of 1972. What happened next to these “one decision” stocks is a tale as old at time. They got too far ahead of themselves and crashed even harder than the market at large during the bear market of 1973-1974. Here are the drawdowns for a handful of these names: Polaroid dropped more than 90%. Avon was down more than 85%. But the tale as old as time here didn’t end following the bear market. The people who always say “This is going to end badly” fail to realize markets keep chugging along. And unless they go out of business or get acquired, so do companies and their stocks. Although the Nifty Fifty stocks got crushed after being bid up so much by investors in the early-1970s, their long-term results were still pretty good. Jeremy Siegel published Revisiting The Nifty Fifty in 1998. He published the annual returns from 1972 through the summer of 1998 for these stocks along with their 1972 P/E ratios and subsequent earnings growth rates: Many of the stocks at the top of the list showed extraordinary performance. Some of these stocks were terrible investments. But you can see over this multi-decade period, this group actually more or less kept up with the overall stock market. Despite crashing from lofty levels, over the long-term the Nifty Fifty did just fine. You could make the case many of the tech stocks that are now one decision names could have a similar experience in the years ahead. A large drawdown in these stocks at some point is almost inevitable. High returns don’t come without high risks. Just look at the historical drawdowns in the FANMAG stocks over time: Amazon fell almost 95% following the dot-com bubble. Apple has seen multiple 60%+ crashes. Microsoft was underwater for more than a decade. Even Netflix was down more than 80% over the last decade. Why does this happen? Who knows. Siegel posits it’s probably just a loss of confidence: The first is that a mania did sweep these stocks, sending them to levels that were totally unjustified on the basis of prospective earnings. The second explanation is that, on the whole, the Nifty Fifty were in fact properly valued at the peak, but a loss of confidence by investors sent them to dramatically undervalued levels. Siegel’s other fascinating discovery (see the warranted P/E ratio in the table above) was how some of these stocks with abnormally high valuations in the 1970s were actually undervalued: What is so surprising is that many of these stocks were worth far more than even the lofty heights that investors bid them. Investors should have paid 68.5 times the 1972 earnings for Philip Morris instead of the 24 they did pay, undervaluing the stock by almost 3-to-1. Coca-Cola was worth over 82 times its earnings, and Merck should have sported a multiple of more than 76. Interestingly, the group that was the most undervalued, and subsequently most successful, catered to brand-name consumer foods, including McDonald’s, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, and even Philip Morris.  IBM, which commanded a price-earnings ratio of 35 in the early 1970s, was actually worth only 17.1 times earnings despite its recent stellar comeback. And while investors paid 45.8 times earnings for Xerox, it was worth only 19.4 times earnings on the basis of its future growth. Polaroid sported the highest price-earnings ratio, selling for a fantastic 94.8 times earnings, almost eight times higher than was justified by its future returns. Who would have thought in the 1970s that a soft drink manufacturer would so thoroughly trounce technology giants such as IBM, Digital Equipment, Texas Instruments, Xerox, and Burroughs? The other side of the one decision nature of these stocks comes from those who point out the growing concentration of these companies at the top of the stock market. The biggest 5 stocks (Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook) now make up more than 17% of the entire U.S. stock market. Granted, this is higher than it has been in recent decades but Dimensional Fund Advisors shows it’s not out of the ordinary over the history of the stock market back to the 1920s: DFA also shows the biggest names can remain king of the mountain for much longer than most investors could imagine: Dimensional notes:  AT&T was among the largest two for six straight decades beginning in 1930. General Motors and General Electric ranked in the top 10 at the start of multiple decades. IBM and Exxon were also mainstays in the second half of the 20th century. Hence, concentration of the stock market in a few large companies such as the FAANG stocks in recent years is not a new normal; it is old normal. This doesn’t mean the largest stocks will continue to outperform. Were that to happen the biggest companies would completely eat the entire stock market. Trees don’t grow to the sky and whatnot. DFA’s analysis shows the annualized excess return after first becoming a top 10 stock in the market shows outperformance of 0.7% over the ensuing 3 years. But over 5 years these new top 10 stocks underperform by 1.1% annually. Over 10 years, that underperformance has been 1.5% annually. There is something for everyone in this data. Overvalued stocks can get wrecked when investors lose confidence in their ability to grow. Sometimes overvalued stocks can still work out fabulously over the long run but it’s smart to diversify among growing companies since many of them are likely to flame out. The biggest stocks can stay big for many years and even decades but that doesn’t mean they will to continue to outperform. Individual stocks are often more confusing than the market itself and can lead to some contradictory outcomes depending on your time horizon and which types of stocks you’re looking at.     This content, which contains security-related opinions and/or information, is provided for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon in any manner as professional advice, or an endorsement of any practices, products or services.

Read More The short term trend of Nifty is positive. One may expect it to move up sharply above 10450 levels in the next 1-2 sessions. The next upside levels to be watched around 10550-10600. Immediate support is placed at 10380-10350 levels. Technically the Nifty broke out of the rangetrade over the past three sessions and is now headed towards 10553. On dips 10338 could provide support. Nifty has major resistance around 10500, and can be expected to have largely range-bound movement in the coming few sessions, in the absence of any major news trigger. Q1 results starting next week would present a true picture of the impact of the pandemic on corporate earnings. Again, it’s the buoyancy of the global markets which aided surge amidst rising cases in India. Besides, though we’re seeing demand revival in select areas, it is still way lower compared to pre-COVID levels. Amid the mixed signals, we feel the upside could remain capped and traders should continue with positive yet cautious stance. We reiterate that the performance of the banking pack would play a critical role in the next directional move as other sectors, by and large, have done their part. Nifty index managed to hold previous day’s close of 10300 zones and witnessed sustained buying interest throughout the day towards 10450 levels. It formed a Bullish Candle on daily scale and started to form higher highs - higher lows from past two trading sessions. It has given a consolidation breakout of last four trading sessions but requires a follow up action to start the next leg of rally. Index has been moving in a rising channel on daily scale by connecting swing lows of 7511, 9004, 9544, 9845, 10250, 10300 levels and supports are gradually higher. Now, it has to continue to hold above 10333 zones to witness an up move towards recent swing high of 10555 then even higher zones while on the downside immediate support is seen at 10300 then 10250 levels. Nifty has been consolidating for the past few sessions and a close above 10400 is expected to invite momentum in the broader markets. Nifty has now formed a strong support at 10250; only a breach of the same is expected to invite selling pressure. Auto, Metals and Capital goods trade with a positive bias while BFSI is gaining momentum. IT and FMCG stocks expected to underperform. Benchmark indices gained strength on the back of data showing that economic activity may be stabilizing. The gains were led by the banking index. The Nikkei PMI survey indicated that although activity contracted in June, it was at a much slower pace as compared to May month. This gives rise to the hope that the economy may be emerging out of one its worst periods in recent times. However, the continued rise in virus infections, and the resulting extension of lockdowns in many areas, may continue to slowdown and impact the economic recovery. Although the market trend is positive, the upside seems to be capped and investors are advised to follow a stock specific strategy. The market was a tad shy of the 10450 level and went to 10447. If we manage to cross today's high tomorrow, we should be in bull territory and the markets would attempt a new high - 10700. The new support would now be 10250. The market sentiment are cautious on fast spreading of coronavirus around the global and concern of the second wave of infections. Also, there are worries over reigniting US-China trade war, giving a boost to safe-haven demand for gold. Today, the MCX Gold has hit a fresh all time high of Rs.48,982/10 gms and is hovering around Rs 48910/10 gms. At the same time, MCX silver continued to trade close to all time high of 50000. Currently the recent high in gold is acting as a crucial resistance and we may see small correction in prices till 47500/47000. However, the ongoing geopolitical tensions will boost safe-haven demand for gold and once it cross and sustains above 49000 then 49750-50600 is expected. Dips will find buying support until 47000 holds and prices will again bounce back towards 48500/49000 levels. While in silver, MCX Sep prices will test its immediate resistance between 51235-51500 areas. The counter needs to trade above these areas for a breakout towards 52400/54000 areas. Failure to trade above 51500 will trigger a correction towards 49750/48800 areas. Gold prices are on an up move due to global uncertainty, the number of new COVID19 cases are on the rise. US Federal Reserve Chairman has stressed the need to control the virus else it may affect the recovery of the US economy.   Gold prices have rallied nearly 24% this year, it had the best quarter (April-June) in more than 4 years in terms of price rise. Internationally, Gold price is near an 8-year high, trading around the USD 1800/oz.   Easy liquidity by central banks across the globe has pushed interest rates down, making gold an attractive investment bet which is also considered a hedge against inflation and a safe haven in times of uncertainties.   Trade tensions between US-China is another worry as it may delay economic recovery and lead to a further rise in prices of the yellow metal. A revival in GST collections during June and a smart comeback by the Banking Sector buoyed sentiments as the market rose over in trade today. The broader market too exhibited strength as savvy investors were seen lapping up select counters who seem to be less impacted from the Pandemic. : Benchmark indices ended higher with Nifty above 10400 supported by the financials and FMCG stocks. At close, the Sensex was up 498.65 points or 1.43% at 35414.45, and the Nifty was up 127.90 points or 1.24% at 10430.

 Today, the rupee (INR) has begun the session on a flattish note against the dollar (USD). It has opened at 75.75 versus its previous close of 75.72 and thus the local currency has slipped below the support of 75.6. If the weakness persists, the rupee might depreciate further to 75.8 and 76 – a critical support. A break below 76 can result in a sharp sell-off. On the other hand, if INR gains and rallies above 75.6, it could advance to 75.4, above which it could move to 75.15. Related StoriesDaily Rupee call: INR likely to appreciate  READ NOW

Based on expert advice in the healthcare sector commercial launch of an effective vaccine seems far away. As and when we have an effective vaccine markets will respond positively at that time. As of now 11,000 seems to be the best case scenario for Nifty-50 based on earnings and valuations,"" Rusmik Oza, Executive Vice President, Head of fundamental Research at Kotak Securities told Moneycontrol. The broader markets also traded in line with benchmark indices as the BSE Midcap index gained 35 percent and Smallcap index rose 40 percent. Moneycontrol collated a list of stocks wherein brokerages initiated coverage with a buy rating and expect 10-50 percent return:  Birlasoft: Buy | Target: Rs 125 | Return: 50.2 percent Emkay Global initiated coverage on Birlasoft with a buy rating and a target of Rs 125, based on 10x FY22E EPS. ""Valuations offer a significant relative margin of safety, given a possible scope of improvement, though the financial history is limited. Global growth challenges and noncommittal pressure on IT spending in FY21 remain the downside risks to our thesis,"" the brokerage said. A large client base and greater impetus on cross-selling through a revamped leadership team should help drive improvement in growth, it feels. Honeywell Automation: Buy | Target: Rs 36,310 | Return: 25.9 percent ""Honeywell Automation (HWA) has outperformed its peers & delivered stellar CAGR of 31/37 percent in EBITDA/Earnings over FY16-20, led by market share gain, rising exports & healthy margin expansion,"" said Yes Securities which believes company's outperformance will sustain based on ongoing product portfolio upgradation, focus on software industrial business model, faster adoption of automated solutions by domestic market post COVID-19 episode & relentless execution on cost control/productivity. ""Given the high entry barrier & access to parent's superior technology, HWA to align its margins with parent's long term target of 24 percent. Unlevered balance sheet offers a tailwind in the event of any major macro slowdown,"" said the brokerage which initiated coverage with buy rating and target of Rs 36,310. Phoenix Mills: Buy | Target: Rs 750 | Return: 24.2 percent JM Financial believes Phoenix is a well-run company that has stuck to its core skill-set of running malls and is scaling this up well. The brokerage initiated coverage with a buy rating and March 2021 target of Rs 750, assuming a 9 percent exit cap rate. ""Key risks include i) the potential delay in scale-up of malls post COVID-19 and ii) a delay in the commissioning of new malls and iii) threat of OTT platforms and e-commerce,"" it said. While FY21 is likely to be a washout for Phoenix (rental waivers, retailer churn, loss of income from events/parking, pressure on rentals, etc.), at these levels, it seems adequately captured in the stock price, said JM Financial which expects a sharp recovery in FY22E based on normalised occupancy and contribution from newer properties. Minda Industries: Buy | Target: Rs 345 | Return: 24.9 percent ""With focus towards premiumization of the existing products, adding more value to the existing components and systems, and next-gen products like controllers and sensors would help Minda Industries to continue its growth journey,"" said IDBI Capital which expects additional revenue from Harita seating, sensors and controller business and 2-wheeler alloy business would help to mitigate the decline in revenue from existing businesses. The brokerage initiated coverage on MIL with a buy rating and a price target of Rs 345 based on 13x FY22E EV/EBITDA. Laurus Labs: Buy | Target: Rs 652 | Return: 13.1 percent Sunidhi Securities likes the company's vision, well-timed, and calibrated investment focus on niche therapy and strong execution track record, which differentiate it from peers. The brokerage expects Laurus to post revenue and profit CAGR of 13 percent and 31 percent over FY20-22E. After providing a capex of Rs 600 crore, it expects free cash flow of Rs 470 crore over FY21-22E, which should result in a significant reduction in debts. Its return on equity is likely to expand from 15.3 percent in FY20 to 19 percent in FY22, said the brokerage which initiated coverage on the stock with a buy rating and price target of Rs 652. Century Textiles: Buy | Target: Rs 436 | Return: 34.4 percent Century Textiles and Industries' business model has gone through complete transformation over last three years post change in guard (from BK Birla to KM Birla) with alignment of business interests with group companies led by demerger of cement business to UltraTech Cement and transfer of rights to manage the VFY business to Grasim Industries and exit from loss making denim and yarn business. ""This transformation has led to sharp de-leveraging of balance sheet and start of generation of free cash flow from remaining operating business segmentâ€™s (pulp & paper, textiles and lease rental). This provides comfort of sustainability of business operation in a current stressed market condition as well as fuel to scale-up of upcoming business (Birla Estate),"" said B&K Securities which re-initiated coverage on the stock with a buy rating and target price of Rs 436. Coromandel International: Buy | Target: Rs 875 | Return: 19.8 percent Antique Stock Broking believes Coromandel International (CRIN) is likely to take big leap as (a) rising share of unique grade fertilizer to support continued market share (MS) gain (b) product innovation and capacity expansion to boost crop protection business and (c) multiple levers to surge EBITDA margins. ""Further, successful implementation of DBT2.0 is likely to play as an option value to drive re-rating in the sector. Coromandel is our preferred pick in the fertilizer space backed by (a) leadership position (b) consistent growth prospects (c) robust FCF generation and best in- Class return profile,"" said the brokerage which initiated coverage on CRIN with a buy rating and target price of Rs 875. CCL Products: Buy | Target: Rs 340 | Return: 36.9 percent Nirmal Bang re-initiated coverage on CCL Products (CCLP), which is India's largest manufacturer and exporter of instant coffee, as superior execution capabilities coupled with strong client relationships has enabled the company to deliver profitable growth over the years. ""CCLP's foray into retail in India through Continental brand will gain critical mass in the next few years. CCLP reported the highest ever 25 percent consolidated EBITDA margin in FY20,"" said the brokerage which believes that over the medium term, Vietnam capacity expansion, higher volume from Freeze Dried Plant (FD) and commissioning of Agglomeration & packing unit would help maintain the margin. ""Deleveraging of balance sheet would give an additional boost to the earnings. We expect around 90 percent of long term debt to be repaid in the next 3 years,"" it added. Greenlam Industries: Buy | Target: Rs 1,059 | Return: 39.4 percent Yes Securities initiated coverage on Greenlam with buy rating and a target price of Rs 1,059. The brokerage remained extremely sanguine about the business prospects of company on the back of strong track record (revenue/EBITDA CAGR of around 15/17.5 percent over FY10-FY19); long growth runway (expect domestic laminate industry to grow at 8-10 percent over next decade); moat in the form of scale benefits (with 18 percent domestic market share, competing neck-to neck with Merino for the top spot in India and third largest globally); and exceptional operating metrics of core business of laminates. Sobha: Buy | Target: Rs 270 | Return: 15.9 percent Sobha has underperformed recently (down 60 percent over past 1 year) due to a) increasing leverage and b) slow scale-up in sales volumes. JM Financial believes Sobha's operating performance has been weak on cash collections in the residential segment leading to debt rising, but expect things to improve post COVID-19 disruption. The brokerage expects growth recovery on a pipeline of launches, which is expected to earn Rs 7,474 crore of net cash flow leading to moderation in debt and higher sales volume. ""These factors make us feel that Sobha is currently in an attractive zone and we initiate coverage with a buy rating and March 2021 target of Rs 270. Key risks are a material slowdown in the launch pipeline,"" JM Financial said. Oberoi Realty: Buy | Target: Rs 435 | Return: 13.6 percent ""Oberoi Realty, a premium mixed use Mumbai based developer, is on the cusp of creating a large annuity portfolio consisting of hotels (Ritz Carlton, Worli and another small hotel in Worli), offices (Goregaon and Worli) and malls (Worli and Borivali) having potential to generate over Rs 1,000 crore in revenue over the next 4-5 years,"" said JM Financial. ""On the residential front, it would be launching the Thane project by 1HFY21 which is expected to be the next big market for Oberoi Realty. Among the existing residential projects, Borivali and Goregaon have been showing steady sales while Worli and Mulund projects have been slow. Going forward, we expect sales to pick-up in residential segment backed by project completion / new launch and new annuity assets to start contributing. We initiate on Oberoi Realty with a buy call and March 2021 target of Rs 435,"" it added. Prestige Estates Projects: Buy | Target: Rs 240 | Return: 11.6 percent ""Prestige Estates has been working towards creating a large annuity portfolio comprising hotels, retail and offices through organic and inorganic growth. It has also been entering new markets (Mumbai, National Capital Region (NCR), Ahmedabad and Hyderabad) opportunistically as it continues to find attractive projects. The residential business provides adequate revenue visibility for the coming 2-3 years with unrecognized revenues and steady collections. Going forward, the embedded trigger is the monetisation of the annuity assets through a combination of stake sale or a REIT listing,"" said JM Financial which initiated coverage on Prestige Estates with a March 2021 target of Rs 240. IIFL Wealth Management: Buy | Target: Rs 1,310 | Return: 31.4 percent ICICI Securities said IIFL Wealth & Asset Management's Q4FY20 earnings reflected focus on transition towards more sustainable recurring revenues (up 14 percent YoY / 2 percent QoQ) and strong momentum in IIFL One (up 10 percent QoQ). ""Transitioning year (FY20) points towards continued build-up of recurring revenue based business model enabling more predictable earnings. Cost controls, reduction in non-sponsor investments and anticipated lower MTM loss will help push operating RoEs to high teens. We expect AUMs to maintain 18-20 percent growth and earnings to grow at over 25 percent,"" said the brokerage which reinitiated with buy and a revised target price of Rs 1,310 (earlier target Rs 1,636). Escorts: Buy | Target: Rs 1,072 | Return: 10.1 percent ""On the back of onset revival across Tractor industry, better traction from companyâ€™s Railway equipment Division, we Initiate BUY rating on the stock with a Target Price of INR 1,072/share valuing at FY22E PE of 18.5x,"" Canara Bank Securities. Government spending on rural areas would be INR 1.45 trillion crore in FY2021 would act as catalyst for reviving tractor demand. Government of India has set a target to double farmer income by 2022, which would not possible without farm mechanization. Indiaâ€™s tractor industry may witness positive sales volume due to positive macro-economic factors. Indian Energy Exchange: Buy | Target: Rs 220 | Return: 16 percent Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) is the monopolistic leader in India's fast-growing spot power (exchanges) market. ""Rapidly changing power industry dynamics and horizontal diversification will further fortify IEX's share by 200bps to 6.3 percent in the 1250Bus conventional power market over the next three years. With potential launch of its gas exchange, IEX's future looks even more exciting,"" said Edelweiss. ""All in all, we conservatively estimate IEX's volumes as well as EPS would expand at a 15 percent CAGR over FY20â€“23E. We are initiating the stock with a buy and DCF-based target of Rs 220. Any reduction in trading margins (currently 4 paisa) and higher competitive intensity are the key risks,"" the brokerage added. Varun Beverages: Buy | Target: Rs 850 | Return: 20.3 percent Emkay Global reinitiated coverage on Varun Beverages with a Buy rating and a target of Rs 850. ""The positive stance is driven by visible market-share-gain opportunities in a healthy growing industry, best-in-class operational efficiencies and improving RoIC profile. CY20E performance will be hit by COVID-19 but long-term growth confidence drives higher-than-consensus estimates. Industry prospects remain healthy with expectations of a around 9.5 percent CAGR in value terms over CY19-24. We expect VBL to grow above the industry levels,"" said the brokerage.

We will try to understand the impact of some factors like the increasing number of confirmed cases in the country, google trend analysis of people searching for COVID-19, correlation with DJIA(Dow Jones Industrial Average), etc. An effective way of understanding the consequences of events like the emergence of COVID-19 is to consider asset price changes. These price changes capture current expectations. Effectively, asset markets provide ongoing,high-stakes surveys regarding future expected outcomes. First, we will begin by importing the required libraries and the dataset required for our analysis. All data used is available on the NSE website We are interested in analyzing the cumulative returns of the NIFTY index over the past 6 months(from 1 Jan 2020). We will use the ‘Adj Close’ column of the dataframe to calculate the returns. The function pct_change() will give the daily percentage change in the closing price of the NIFTY-50 index. We can clearly observe that the market was most volatile during the month of March and maximum losses occurred then. The cumulative return for the month of March was -0.263 which is 26.3% loss in one month. Now, we will compute a very popular measure of risk called Maximum Drawdown which gives you the maximum loss that you could have experienced if you had been unlucky enough to buy the asset at its very peak and sold it at the very bottom. This is basically the worst return you could experience. Drawdown is a measure of the maximum downside risk. To calculate drawdown, we first calculate the wealth index and the prior peaks at all points of time(i.e. since inception whats the highest value experienced). drawdown.min()will give the maximum drawdown occurred during the period under consideration, and drawdown.idxmin() gives the timestamp when the maximum loss occurred. We found that the maximum drawdown observed was -38.44%, observed on 23 March 2020. This was the very next trading day after the one day Janata curfew on 22 March. One thing was clear that there was not much observable correlation between the number of confirmed coronavirus cases and the NIFTY prices/returns. However, analyzing the google search trend results in India(on COVID-19) gives an important takeaway that it is the public sentiment that had the most impact on the market prices and volatility. The market sentiment in response to the outbreak can be quickly amplified through social media which then stimulates trade activities and cause extreme price movements. The stock market basically provided us a view of what the investors expected for the future. Google search trend data can be downloaded from here and can also be downloaded from the datasets folder in my Github Repository. The Google search intensity on coronavirus in India increased massively in March which peaked around the last week of March(23–24 March 2020). It subsided somewhat after its interim peak at the beginning of April. During this period(March-April) the google search intensity factor can be seen to be highly negatively correlated to the NIFTY index with a correlation of -0.685. Also the overall correlation from 1 March 2020 till 15 June 2020 is -0.52. From this, we can see that search query data is relevant to analyzing the public sentiment regarding the pandemic and hence its effect on financial markets. Another important, although expected correlation we can find is between the Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJIA) and NIFTY prices. Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJIA) is a stock market index that tracks 30 large, publicly-owned blue-chip companies trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ. The dataset can be obtained from the Yahoo Finance website. During the period from 1 Jan 2020 till 17 June, there seems to be a very high correlation of 0.93 between the two market indices. We can clearly see that only industry with positive cumulative return in this period is the Pharmaceutical industry. The Nifty Pharma index had a return of 22.6% in April 2020, while the broader Nifty50 is up only by 6%. Due to the sector’s relative resilience to Covid-19 disruption, a positive stance can be observed on Indian Pharmaceutical Stocks. From the plot below(cumulative returns of various industry indices from 1 Jan 2020 till 17 June 2020) we can clearly see that Banking Sector, Financial Services, Realty, Retail, and Automobiles are at the front among the sectors that were most affected. The stock price decline has been higher in firms with their chains extending to multiple pandemic-hit countries since it affects more of their international supply networks and not just the local supplies. The results suggest that the market very quickly began to react to concerns about the possible economic consequences of the COVID-19. We observed some large price moves in the month of March when investors started to become apprehensive about potential amplification of the COVID-19 shock through financial channels. The stock price captured the expectations of market participants regarding future economic consequences. Also, we can see that there is a causal direct relationship between Google trend metrics for COVID-19 and market volatility. The elevated anxiety produced by the increased search for consequences concerning the pandemic has a negative impact on market returns. And that’s it! We have come to the end of the article. The complete code can be found in my Github repository here. Feel free to leave any suggestions, questions, or comments! -- -- Towards Data Science 4th Year Undergraduate at IIT Kharagpur.

Indian markets managed to reclaim crucial resistance levels for the week ended June 18 supported by buying in top index heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, Bajaj Finance, Maruti Suzuki, etc. Indian market managed to climb all wall of worries in the week gone by be it rise in COVID-related cases, global rating action or border standoff between India and China. Analysts attribute the rise to short covering in the key benchmark names as hope takes center stage. “Markets spearheaded higher in spite of all the pessimism surrounding economic growth prospects – India-China border tussle, India Inc.’s weak quarterly performance as well as slow demand revival in the real economy,” Jimeet Modi, Founder & CEO, SAMCO Securities & StockNote told Moneycontrol. “‘Hope’ the single most emotion is rallying markets higher on the pretext that things will normalise in the next three to six months. At the same time, management commentary after quarterly results, in general, suggests that Q1FY21 will be washout quarter,” he said. The S&P BSE Sensex rallied 2.8 percent while the Nifty50 rose 2.7 percent for the week ended June 19 compared to 1.6 percent gain seen in the S&P BSE Mid-cap index, and 3.6 percent rally seen in the S&P BSE Small-cap index – outperforming benchmark indices in the same period. In the S&P BSE Small-cap index, as many as 194 stocks which rallied 10-60 percent in the same period. Stocks that gave double-digit returns include names like Birla Corp, Suven Life, Trent, Dhanuka Agritech, Mirza International, DCB Bank, LT Foods, Skipper, Usha Martin, Dhanlakxmi Bank, OM Metals, and Nectar Lifesciences, etc. among others. Here is a list of top 13 stocks out of 194 that have risen more than 30%  ""The mid-cap and small-cap indices have outperformed to gain by 9.7 percent and 14.3 percent respectively compared to NIFTY50 to gain by 6.9 percent MTD. Mid-caps and Small-caps are seeing a valuation catch up as smart allocation of money by funds and high net worth clients is investing in regular phases of corrective markets,"" Vikas Jain, Senior Research Analyst at Reliance Securities told Moneycontrol. ""The global markets are also too supportive and the results season has not witnessed any major negative surprise and trading below the average valuations provides a lot of comforts,"" he said. Technical View:  The Nifty carried with positive momentum for the second consecutive session in a row and headed towards 10,250 zones. It continued to make higher highs on an hourly scale as the day progressed and concluded the session near to its day’s high. The index has been moving in a rising channel on a daily scale by connecting swing lows of 7,511, 9,004, 9,544 and 9,845 marks, and recently it has turned from its support zones of 50 DEMA. Experts are of the view that if Nifty close above 10,180 levels then the upmove could extend towards 10,333-10,500 levels. “We witnessed follow up buying post a breakout from a Triangle pattern on an intraday scale which indicates that momentum may continue. RSI also turned northwards and gave positive crossover with its average, which has a bullish implication,” Chandan Taparia, Vice President | Analyst-Derivatives at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited told Moneycontrol. “Now, it has to continue to hold above 10,180 zones to extend its move towards 10,333 then 10,500 zone, while support is now shifting higher to 10,040 and 10,000 levels,” he said.

Read More Benchmark indices traded positive today while the global cues were mixed. European markets again opened in the negative awaiting the US FOMC announcements. Although the FED is expected to maintain status quo, markets will be looking out for any hints, which could impact the markets, the direction depending on whether it is hawkish or dovish in tone. Stock specific action continued in the markets and we would suggest increasing allocation in quality names. The market took a dramatic turn in the second half of the trading session on buying in private banks and NBFCs, as Nifty continued to hold above the 10000 mark. The market mostly traded in a narrow range due to uncertain global cues and nervousness ahead of the outcome of the US Fed meet. Tomorrow could be the most crucial day for the market as the market has formed a tight range-bound activity and on the dismissal of the trading range, Nifty would enter in trending (impulsive) activity. Above the level of 10150, Nifty would move to 10350 and below the level of 10000, Nifty may fall to 9950. The swing low of 10021 now becomes a crucial support & holds the key for further extension on the upside. On the higher side, bulls need to take out the resistance zone of 10300-10328 inorder to stretch towards 10550, which is 61.8% retracement of the Jan - March fall. Markets have been consolidating in the range of 10000-10300 since the past few trading sessions. Midcap space witnessed build up in momentum and we expect the same to continue. Currently all data parameters suggest buying on dips. On the sectoral front expect banking and metal stocks to lead while positivity is also seen in Auto and Commodity space. Markets will react to the US Fed meet outcome in early trade on Thursday i.e. June 11. We reiterate our view focusing more on banking and financials as they hold the key for further up move in the Nifty else consolidation may continue. Technically the Nifty remains in the 10035-10175 band. A move either way will decide the near term direction of the market. On technical front Nifty traded in range of 10040-10140 range and managed to sustain above 10000 level which signifies strength in counter. On an hourly chart index manages to trade above 50 HMA which points out positive biasness in the counter. At present level index is having good support at 10000 level while resistance comes at 10290 levels. Bulls firmly in control today and heartening to see some of the stressed private sector banks as well as public sector banks rally ferociously which apparently means things are infact not as bad as it is made out to be. Improved market breadth in itself presents several opportunities for savvy investors. The markets traded sideways the entire day.

Invest Now The Nifty50 rallied for six straight sessions in a row to close above its crucial resistance level of 10,000 for the first time since March 11. It rallied 1000 points since May 26 when the Nifty index closed at 9,029. It hit an intraday low of 8,996 on the same day. The Nifty50 closed 82 points higher at 10,061 on June 4. The level of 10,000-10,100 was being considered as a crucial resistance level for the index, and on expected lines, the index faced resistance above 10,100 levels. The question now is – will the rally continue? The last 1000-point rally on Nifty was fast and furious, but the journey from here might not be as smooth, suggest experts. Traders are advised to lighten their position, they say. “Last couple of weeks have been excellent for our markets as we rallied more than 1000 points on Nifty before anyone could realise. Today we finally broke that sturdy wall and has managed to enter the five-digit territory beyond 10000. But from here on the next move will not be as smooth as it has been over the past few days,” Sameet Chavan (Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives, Angel Broking told Moneycontrol. “In our sense, as long as we are holding 9900-9700, the possibility of extending this move cannot be ruled out. Wednesday’s ‘continuation gap’ would be crucial because the immediate gap-filling process would lead to an ‘exhaustion gap’, which may probably apply brakes on the ongoing momentum,” he said. Chavan further added that the coming session would be quite crucial (especially for Banknifty). On the upside, once we see Nifty surpassing 10200, the move is likely to extend towards 10400-10600, which would be then seen as a cluster of resistances. India VIX remained flattish and marginally fell down by 0.24 percent at 30.04 levels. The volatility index is hovering around its support of 30 levels and lower VIX is supporting the higher market base, suggest experts. Banking stocks led the rally for the second day. Bank Nifty continued its winning streak for seventh consecutive sessions as it rallied towards 21600 zones. However, it corrected sharply by more than 700 points from higher levels in the last hour of the session but managed to close with the gains of around 2 percent. “Nifty has rallied by more than 1100 points in just six trading sessions so now it may see a consolidative move before starting the next leg of the rally. As of now, the trend is intact to positive till it holds immediate support of 9889 zones while hurdles are seen at 10200-10300 zones,” Chandan Taparia, Vice President | Analyst-Derivatives at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd told Moneycontrol. “Traders are now suggested to keep the position light with trail SL as a drift below 9889 may cause in a pause in the recent upside rally. Now the rate-sensitive index (NiftyBank) might see some consolidation with immediate support at 20500 then 20000 while hurdle at 21600 then 22000 zones,” he said. On the monthly options front, the maximum Put OI is placed at 9000 followed by 9500 strikes, while maximum Call OI is at 10000 followed by a 10500 strikes. Data suggests that marginal Call writing in 11000 followed by 10800 strikes while Put writing is seen at 9600 followed by 10000 strikes. Options data suggests a wider trading range between 9700 to 10300 zones. “Running corrections are bound to be there in a bullish trend. Nifty has risen for 6 straight sessions. So there could be a small breather after a steep rise. However, the positional trend of Nifty should remain bullish, as Nifty has formed a higher top above 9889 preceded by the higher bottom,” Vinay Rajani, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst – Retail Research at HDFC Securities told Moneycontrol. “Considering the technical setup, Nifty is looking strong and likely to extend the rally above 10000. There could be small corrections at regular intervals but the same should be utilized to initiate fresh long positions,” he said. Rajani further added that previous resistance is now expected to interchange its role as a support at 9890 odd levels. So this level is a nice level to initiate fresh longs with the stop loss of 9700. On the upside the, range of 10160-10334, the unfilled gap area on the daily chart would act as a resistance.

Invest Now  The Indian market witnessed a volatile week, but bulls regained their control on D-Street in the second half of the week pushing the S&P BSE Sensex above 32,000 while the Nifty50 reclaimed 9,550 levels. On a weekly basis, the Nifty50 rose 6 percent while the S&P BSE Sensex gained 5.7 percent for the week while the S&P BSE Mid-cap index rose 5.08 percent and the S&P BSE Small-cap index gained 3.5 percent for the week ended May 29. There are as many as 94 stocks in the S&P BSE Small-cap index gained 10-30 percent that includes names such as Orient Cement, Subex, HOEC, JBF Industries, Alok Industries, Prozone, Birla Corp and Skipper.   Indian markets largely mirrored movement seen in the United States' markets despite growing cases of COVID-19 in India as well as globally. But, growing tensions between the US and China capped gains.“Although the number of new infections remained elevated in India, the general expectation was that the economy would slowly start emerging out of restrictions, post-Lockdown 4.0, except in the hotspots,” Vinod Nair- Head of Research- Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.“Globally, the markets heaved a sigh of relief after more stimulus packages were announced by China, the European Union, and other countries, following the easing of lockdown measures. However, these gains were somewhat clouded by the persistent US-China tensions, which threatened to affect the global trade and recovery process,” he said. Strong rollovers for the June series as well as a close above 9,500 on the Nifty suggest that the momentum could well continue as long as the index holds above 9,400 levels. But, muted global cues as well as weak gross domestic product (GDP) GDP print for the March quarter could cap the upside. ""Indian market’s underperformance can be attributed to the stringent and extended lockdown and lack of near-term direct benefits from the government to jump-start the economy,” Jimeet Modi, Founder & CEO, SAMCO Securities & StockNote told Moneycontrol. “This bull bear tussle phase is likely to continue for a few more months before investors can see any significant lasting up move in the indices,"" he said. Technical View: The Nifty50 registered a bullish candle on a weekly basis tracking positive global cues. Sectorally, all major indices ended the week in the green lead by financials, metal, and auto. The weekly price action resembles a ‘Morning Star’ candle as the index witnessed follow-through strength to last week’s Hammer-like candle, indicating the conclusion of the secondary corrective phase. Data suggests that the Nifty50 has witnessed the longest pullback in the past four weeks as the index rallied 800 points, compared to the previous up move of 541 points. The crucial support for the index is placed at 9,200 and the Nifty50 could well retest 10,000 levels. Possibility of cool off is high as the index trades near key resistance levels, suggest experts but that should be used to go long, they say. “Elongated up move supported by improving the market breadth, indicates broad-based participation, boding well for durability of the ongoing uptrend,” Dharmesh Shah, Head – Technical, ICICI direct told Moneycontrol. “This makes us confident that the index would resolve higher and eventually challenge the psychological mark of 10,000 in the coming weeks,” he said. Shah further added that any cool off from here on should not be considered as negative instead it should be capitalised as incremental buying opportunity to ride the next leg of the up move.

Read More The benchmark indices staged an intraday rally in sync with global cues, as some pockets of value buying emerged. Inspite of rising number of infections, markets expect slow return to normalcy, when lockdown 4.0 ends this week. All sectoral indices were in the green and Institutional buying in banking stocks helped the bank index gain by over 7%. The volatility is expected to continue, ahead of tomorrow’s F&O expiry. Finally the Index settled its closing at 9315 level with the gain of 285 points and managed to give a closing above 9300 level which is a good sign for the time being. Moreover, mostly large cap constituents performed well which help the index to climb above 9300 level. Even BankNifty performed very well after giving a jovial opening, lastly closed at 18710 level with the gain of 1270 points. At present level, downside support comes at 9200-9100 while upside resistance comes at 9350-9450. Technically the Nifty seems to have made an intermediate bottom at 8806 on May 18 going by the extent of rise today. It could now face resistance at the downgap resistance of 9351 and later at 9553. On falls it could take support at 9179. urities: Markets have been consolidating in the past few trading sessions. Trend support for Nifty50 is seen at 8800; broader markets remain strong above the same. On the higher side the initial target is seen at 9500, above which further upside up to 10000 remains a possible. Open interest concentration is seen at 9000 put and 10000 call for the June series. Open interest addition is seen in Banking and IT stocks; expect the same to trade with a positive bias. The Nifty50 more than made up for its sluggish trading over the last few days - in today's session, we did not breach the crucial level of 8980 but went right ahead and crossed 9175 which was the price point for the upside to get activated. The markets moved smartly and with an extraordinary vigor and closed above 9300. If we can keep above 9350 in the next few trading sessions, we could achieve levels closer to 9700. : Indian indices ended strong on May 27 with Nifty above 9300 level and Sensex also reclaimed 31,000 mark supported by banking names.

"NDTV ProfitWhat The Charts Are Saying About Indian Stock MarketWith headline indices expected to remain range-bound, technical analysts remain focused on specific stocks going into next week..24 May 2020",https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/what-the-charts-are-saying-about-indian-stock-market,24 May 2020,Nifty 50 Weekly Performance: What The Charts Are Saying About Indian Stock Market,"India’s equities ended lower for the third straight week as concerns over a weak economic outlook amid mounting Covid-19 cases in the country and fresh tension between the U.S. and China marred sentiment. Through the week, the Nifty 50 Index recovered close to 370 points from its Monday’s low of 8,806.75. But the benchmark pared some of its gains to close at 9,039.25 on Friday after the Monetary Policy Committee cut repo rate by 40 basis points in a second emergency move, citing “severe” impact of the virus outbreak on the Indian economy. “The Indian markets will open on Tuesday, and on opening, they will adjust to a global trade setup that will transpire on Monday. In any case, however, no significantly wild opening on the higher side is expected,” Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA, technical analyst and founder of Gemstone Equity Research, said. “The coming week will see the levels of 9,162 and 9,235 acting as overhead resistance points. The supports will come in at 8,965 and 8,800 levels. Any move on the downside is likely to make the trading range wider than usual.” According to Brijesh Bhatia, research head at Dealmoney Securities Pvt., there are clear signs of weakness at higher levels when observing the lower time frame charts of the Nifty. “The bulls managed to protect the 9,000-mark on the Nifty after falling briefly below that level on Friday. As we move into the truncated week, we believe the range of 8,800-9,372 will be critical. For the bulls, the upper level of the descending triangle and the 89-day exponential moving average act as a very strong resistance. It will be difficult to predict which way markets are headed until we see a decisive break on either side of the range.” With the headline indices expected to remain range-bound, technical analysts remain focused on specific stocks and sectors going into the next week. The Relative Rotation Graph, used to gauge relative strength of equities against a common benchmark and each other, suggests relative strength in select Nifty 50 and IT stocks. ITC Ltd., Bajaj Auto Ltd., Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., HCL Technologies Ltd. and Cipla Ltd. are seen steadily building upon their relative momentum and are likely to outperform the headline index. “Cipla, which is placed the farthest from the centre point is likely to offer more alpha capturing opportunity,” Vaishnav said. On the other hand, there could be further weakness in Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. and Titan Company Ltd. as they move from the weakening to the lagging quadrant. Besides, JSW Steel Ltd. and HDFC Ltd. are in the lagging quadrant and appear to be losing their relative momentum when compared against the Nifty 50 Index, Vaishnav said. Technical charts suggest that the underperformance of India’s mid-cap stocks may see a reversal after the worst selloff since the 2008 global financial crisis. “The ratio of the Nifty Midcap Index divided by Nifty 50 Index shows that it has retraced 78.60 percent of the entire rally from the end of 2014 to January 2018,” Bhatia of Dealmoney Securities said. “On two separate occasions (2009 and 2013) in the past, we’ve seen such a massive underperformance of the mid-cap index versus the Nifty. On both of those occasions, however, the maximum retracement was 78.60 percent, after which there has been a trend reversal. The Relative Strength Index, too, is showing a positive divergence.” Bhatia referred to the Fibonacci retracement levels—the horizontal lines that indicate where support and resistance are likely to occur in a particular security. The Nifty Midcap100 Index has tumbled 40 percent since January 2018 compared to a 13 percent fall in Nifty 50 during the period.",nifty index relative week 50

This is likely due to the two-year imbalance among Index stocks that was destroyed due to the crash. A performance report on active large cap funds. Have they returned? Will they do better in the future?  After 1st Feb 2018, the equity market went in two different directions. A few stocks with the most weight in the Nifty/Sensex moved up while the rest of the market – the remaining Nifty stocks, Nifty Next 50, midcaps and small caps started moving down. As a result, the outperformance of several actively managed mutual funds, especially in the large cap category became prominently visible.  This trend seems to have reversed now. If you have checked the past 1-year returns in the large cap category just a few months ago, Sensex and Nifty index funds would have dominated the table (prior Feb 2018 Nifty Next 50 funds were on top). Today all these index funds are closer to the bottom of the table. All trailing returns were calculated wrt May 15th 2020. We looked at these 27 active large cap funds: Over the last seven years, 22/27 (81%) funds beat the NIfty and Nifty 100 TRI. Note all returns are after expenses. Over the last year too, 22/27 funds (not the same ones!) outperformed the two indices. This is what happened in the middle! Clearly the overvaluation of a few NIfty stocks (which we have not seen at least since the 2000s) and the subsequent correction has impacted how well active funds fared before and after the crash. What does this mean to the investor? Does this mean active large cap funds are back? No. In Dec 2018 only Five Large Cap funds had comfortably beaten Nifty 100 and this was a thorough study based on rolling returns. Using the same criterion on the May 2020 Equity Mutual Fund Performance Screener we get only three funds! Even if we use regular large cap funds and investigate bet April 2006 to Dec 2017 (before the onset of this market homogeneity) only 9/22 fund have consistently beaten NIfty 100 TRI over 3,5,7 and 10 years (over 70% of all rolling return data points). So clearly even before the “80%  from Nifty 100” SEBI mandate, active large cap funds had trouble beating the Nifty 100. So why are you confusing us with data then? There is always going be some data like this. Some Yes Bank, some Vedanta, some index fund moving up the star rating ladder, moving down etc. If you chose index funds because that is going to outperform active funds “in the long run” then you are likely to be disappointed at least from time to time. Choose passive funds only because of the additional risk in active funds – loss of performance risk, star ratings change risk, fund manager losing it risk, fund manager quitting-risk.

Invest Now  Over the years, sectoral representation in the Nifty50 has undergone a sea of change, in line with changes in the underlying economy. The Financials which have gained weightage since 2005 now seem to be losing their control on the index, Motilal Oswal noted in a report. While new sectors have evolved, some of the erstwhile dominant sectors have lost their relevance in the new India. Also, the recent correction led by the COVID-19 pandemic has entailed some interesting changes in the Nifty’s sectoral representations. Financials have had a dominant run in the last decade; the contribution of BFSI has risen secularly in the Nifty50 from 22.7 percent in December 2009 to 42 percent in December 2019 (+1.9x in 10 years), highlighted the report. While the share of Private Banks/NBFCs in the index has gone up substantially, that of PSU Banks has declined, which highlights the underlying value migration in favour of private financials. The recent correction post the COVID-19 crisis has impacted Financials disproportionately given the economy-wide lockdown for the past seven weeks and its potential direct as well as indirect ramifications for loan growth, asset quality, and moratorium impact, highlighted the report. Financials’ loss has been the gain of defensives like Consumer, Technology, Pharma, and Telecom. After this correction, BFSI’s weight in the Nifty is now at a 3-year low of 33.9 percent, down 810bp (versus December 2019). Experts are of the view that COVID-19 might change the way businesses are run in the future, and stress in the banking sector might increase which is why other sectors are gaining traction that are likely to perform better. “COVID-19 might change the way business would perform in the next two years. There is significant weightage given to oil & gas, Tech, consumer and telecom sectors as it might get more traction compared to banks and NBFC, as demand is subdued and might take more time to build up,” Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at  CapitalVia Global Research Limited- Investment Advisor told Moneycontrol. “In my opinion telecom and technology stocks would out-perform amongst its constituent NIFTY-50 peers,” he said.  Oil and Gas (O&G) has seen a large increase in weight thanks to the huge outperformance of Reliance Industries. Oil & Gas gained 310 bps since December 2019 and now constitutes 15.6 percent of the Nifty in 2020.Interestingly, a large part of the rally in Reliance Industries (RIL) has been led by developments in Telecom i.e. Reliance Jio. After the series of investments from multiple entities in Jio Platforms over the last three weeks, the company is now moving toward becoming debt-free. In fact, Reliance Jio now constitutes 50 percent of RIL’s SOTP. Technology has seen good interest owing to its defensive nature with strong cash-rich balance sheets while telecom is expected to see the minimum impact of COVID-19. Hence, the sector has seen significant outperformance in the recent correction, added the note. ""The COVID-19 impact has thrown all dynamics out of gear of even the most resilient of sectors, and most of the sectors are grappling to survive this onslaught of colossal financial damage. Hence, investors are advised to go slow in investing, and not rush in all at once,"" Aamar Deo Singh, Head Advisory, Angel Broking Ltd told Moneycontrol. ""Also, diversification and focus only and only on quality stocks is the need of the hour. Till such time, we do not see a clear cut way out of the present crisis, it would too early to say that we are out of the woods yet,"" he said. 48 percent of Nifty50 constituents remain unchanged: As many as 48 percent of Nifty50 constituents or 24 stocks remain unchanged over 15 years. Of these 24, four are from Auto, Oil & Technology, each, two from Private Banks, Consumer, Metals & Healthcare and one each from NBFC, Capital Goods, PSU Banks & Telecom. Stocks that remain unchanged include Infosys, HCL Tech, ITC, HUL, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki, M&M, and Hero MotoCorp, according to Motilal Oswal report.  The combined weight of these 24 stocks declined to 73.9 percent compared to 77.5 percent 15 years ago, but was up from 60.2 percent in December 2007.  In Private Financials, all three stocks – HDFC Bank (+8.7%), HDFC (+5.2%) and ICICI Bank (+1.6%) – have seen an increase in weights over the last 15 years. Among these 24 stocks, oil & gas has been the biggest loser in terms of weight, and in Consumer, ITC has significantly underperformed HUL and for the first time, HUL’s weight in the Nifty has overtaken ITC. Experts feel that these 24 companies are a sectoral leader and could well remain part of the Nifty50 in the near future as well; hence, investors should remain invested in case they hold the stocks. “Most of the high performing giants continue to be on Nifty50 list, but I expect some addition from the consumption sector and a few insurance stocks. Half of the constituents of Nifty50 have been there for 15 years and in my opinion, they will continue to be part of it,” said Garg of CapitalVia Global Research Limited.

Invest Now  Taking Stock: Sensex give up 32,000 amid weak global cues, stimulus package Sectorally, some buying was seen in healthcare, FMCG, and capital goods stocks while selling was witnessed in IT, Energy, Finance, Metals, Bankex, and Public sector stocks.... Read More The markets traded negative today on account of negative global cues and were circumspect regarding the implementation and the effectiveness of the stimulus package announced by the government. The government has made it clear that the measures will be announced in tranches and not in one go. Investors are still looking for measures to boost the demand and not just inject liquidity, which so far has been the focus from the government. The FM's press conference later on will be looked at for more cash in hand measures and the funding details of the package. Nifty is currently placed at the edge of immediate support at 9100-9050 levels and a sustainable move below this area could open further steep weakness in the market. The next downside levels to be watched around 8900. Immediate resistance is placed at 9250 levels. The markets exhibited weakness throughout the trading session on weak global cues. Technology stocks witnessed heavy selling pressure on the back of weakness in U.S. based technology index. Financial stocks also closed at the day's lowest levels, which is negative for long term investors and also indicating that institutional investors are still sellers. On intraday basis, Nifty closed at the lower boundary of the trading range. Till the market is not breaking the lowest level of 9040, we should avoid taking any short call with a short term view. Resistance for Nifty exists at 9250 and 9300 levels. Technically, Nifty has fallen with a downgap and closed near its intraday low. The trend continues to be down. On upmoves it could face resistance at 9236, while 9044 could offer support to the Nifty on downmoves. During the Trading session, mostly we have seen selling pressure only and it seems that the ongoing movement may continue further as all the large cap constituents are trading on a lower level. Furthermore, after declaring the Mega Rescue Package by our PM Narendra Modi, the market couldn’t capitalize the momentum and started to fell from its recent high. At present level, the index has strong resistance at 9350 while downside good support comes at 9100 level. The Nifty opened gap down on May 14 & remained under pressure throughout the day. Consequently, the index has once again fallen below its crucial daily moving averages. This shows that the bears are having upper hand on the index. The short term momentum indicators also continue to favor the bears. Thus the index looks set to break the near term support zone of 9050-9000. Once the support breaks 8820-8800 will be the subsequent target area to watch out for. On the flip side, any bounce towards 9200-9250 is likely to attract another round of selling. Markets traded weak throughout the day with IT stocks dragging Indices as Gartner predicts IT spend to decline 8%. Automobile stocks led by Maruti staged a smart recovery even as Reliance dragged. Indian markets opened on a negative note following overnight negative close in US markets as US Fed warned that the coronavirus crisis raises longer-term growth concerns and could result in an extended period of low productivity growth and stagnant incomes. During the afternoon session the markets further weakened as truncated WPI data further added to pessimism which showed deflation in primary articles to 0.79% in April-20 as against inflation of 3.72% in March-20; food inflation cooled to 3.60% in April-20 from 5.49% in March-20. On sectoral front, the decline in the markets was led by IT, Financial, Metals and Realty while Pharma and FMCG remained marginally positive. : The benchmark indices wiped out all the previous session gains with Nifty ended below 9150 level on May 14 on the back of profit booking amid weak global cues. At close, the Sensex was down 885.72 points or 2.77% at 31122.89, and the Nifty was down 240.80 points or 2.57% at 9142.75. About 968 shares have advanced, 1324 shares declined, and 153 shares are unchanged. Hindalco Industries, Tech Mahindra, Infosys, HDFC and Gail were among losers on the Nifty, while gainers were Bharti Infratel, Zee Entertainment, Hero MotoCorp, L&T and Maruti Suzuki. Among sectors, except pharma and FMCG other indices ended lower. BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices down 0.3-0.7 percent.  The company has approved the issuance of listed, Secured, Redeemable, Non-convertible Debentures (NCDs), with an aggregate amount upto Rs 300 crore with a green-shoe option of Rs 200 crore, on private placement basis, in one or more tranches.

Invest Now  The Nifty50, which reclaimed its 50-days moving average also known as short-term moving average on Thursday, gave up most of the gains and closed sharply lower on Monday. The Nifty50 broke below its crucial 50-DMA on May 4 placed around 9,800 levels. The last time when the index traded above this crucial level was in February 2020. Not just Nifty but there are over 70 percent of the stocks in the Nifty500 index that are trading below their crucial short term (50-DMA) as well as the long term moving average (200-DMA). There are as many as 361 stocks in the Nifty500 index that are trading below their 50-DMA, and 200-DMA. These include MRF, Shree Cement, Page Industries, Bajaj Finserv, UltraTech Cements, HDF AMC, Bajaj Finance, Maruti Suzuki and Bosch, data from AceEquity showed. Note: Here is a list of 50 stocks out of 361 in the Nifty500 index that are trading below 50, and 200-DMA.  The 50-DMA is popularly used by technical chartists to identify the trend. A close above 50-DMA and if Nifty50 manages to sustain above these levels could have open doors for the index to march towards 10,000. The moving average is used commonly by traders to interpret the trend. A move below 50-DMA is considered bearish in the intermediate-term or a trend change towards the downside while a close above the same is considered a bullish sign. Technically, the Nifty50 formed an ‘Island Reversal’ pattern on the daily charts on Monday which is a reversal pattern, and the next big support for the index is placed at 9250, and below that 8900-8800, suggest experts. “The Nifty50 appears to have reversed its trend with an Island Reversal formation perhaps owing to weak global cues which were accompanied with a further extension of lockdown,” Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research &amp; Trading Advisory, at Chartviewindia.in told Moneycontrol. “Technically, indices should remain under pressure unless they close above 9732 levels. In such a scenario all pull back attempts towards 9500 levels shall be considered as an opportunity to create fresh short positions,” he said. Mohammad further added that some support on the downside can be expected around 9250 levels and breach of this minor support shall drag it down towards its near term critical support of 8900 levels breach of which shall confirm bigger downsides for this market. What should investors do? The Nifty50 moved up sharply in April largely on news about a possible breakthrough in a drug that could cure COVID-19 patients. The Nifty50 rallied by over 14 percent in April and the majority of the gains were seen in the last week. The Nifty had moved up sharply over the past few weeks by about 30 percent from its panic bottom of 7,500 to closer to 9,800 levels, but fundamentals of the economy were still weak and investors were looking for a trigger to book profits. Expectations of further escalation of a trade war between US and China, grim economic data back home, recent earnings from India Inc. have not been inspiring, zero sales in the auto sector, rise in COVID-19 cases in India and across the globe, as well as the extension of lockdown are some of the factors which weighed on sentiment. Experts feel that traders should focus on stock-specific opportunities as volatility is likely to remain high. “Going ahead, all eyes would be on further development with respect to Donald Trump’s threat. In case of further escalation, we may see Nifty correcting towards 9100 - 9000; whereas on the flip side, 9390 followed by 9450 would be seen as immediate hurdles,” Sameet Chavan (Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives, Angel Broking) told Moneycontrol. “As of now, we hope things do not worsen from here and Nifty manages to find support in the zone of 9250-9200 levels. Traders are advised to stay light and keep a close eye on the above-mentioned scenarios,” he said. Chavan further added that at present, individual stocks are providing good trading opportunities and hence, it’s advisable to focus on such potential candidates. Arun Kumar, Market Strategist, Reliance Securities recommends stocks such as Aarti Drugs, Alembic Pharma, Aurobindo Pharma, Biocon, Cadila Healthcare, Cipla, Divis Lab, Dr.Reddy’s Lab and Lupin which have good setup from a long-term perspective.

 Yvette Arrington with the New York Stock Exchange trading floor operations watches the market slide on March 9 as coronavirus fears grip the financial markets. No one predicted what a tumultuous, stomach-churning year 2020 would be for the stock markets. And few foresaw how well it would end up. Here are the highlights: Stocks in meltdown Between Feb. 12 and March 23, the Dow lost a stunning 37% of its value. On March 16 alone, the Dow plummeted nearly 3,000 points, losing 12.9%, as investors worried about the prospect of economic destruction wrought by COVID-19. The drop in stock prices was so large and so swift that it triggered multiple trading halts that day. In fact, the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading several times during those days. The worst-hit stocks were those affected by the travel restrictions, such as cruise lines, air carriers and energy companies. United Airlines stock fell to $24 in March after selling for $86 a share on Jan. 1.  Historic recession It was a chilling time for investors, when the bottom seemed to be falling out of the global economy. Some 22 million jobs were lost in April and May in the United States as businesses were forced into lockdown mode. ""The scope and speed of this downturn are without modern precedent, significantly worse than any recession since World War II,"" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on March 13. Then a dramatic rebound Then something surprising happened: The stock market rebounded. With a vengeance. Throughout the summer and fall, prices began to creep up again, and by Aug. 18, the Standard and Poor's 500 was hitting records again. And the Dow  crossed 30,000 for the first time ever on Nov. 24. ""It's a sacred number, 30,000,"" President Trump said at the White House. ""Nobody thought they'll ever see it.""  Even with all the tumult, the Dow finished the year up 7.2%, and the S&P 500 did even better, gaining 16.3%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite index, which is dominated by hot technology stocks, soared by a whopping 43.6%. Congress, Fed and Treasury to the rescue What on earth was going on?  The Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department and Congress took quick, decisive action to support the economy during the worst of the meltdown.  Congress approved supplemental unemployment benefits and $1,200 stimulus checks that helped many of the hardest-hit Americans pay their rent and keep food on the table. And the U.S. Treasury got those checks out quickly. The Fed cut interest rates to near zero, and then stepped in with a broad $2.3 trillion package of lending programs to prop up households, employers, financial markets and local governments.  ""We are deploying these lending powers to an unprecedented extent [and] ... will continue to use these powers forcefully, proactively and aggressively until we are confident that we are solidly on the road to recovery,"" Powell said in April. All this sent a message to the financial markets: The Fed isn't about to let you go under. Buoyed by those assurances, investors began dipping their toes back in the water. Tech bonanza Initially, much of the market's gains were driven by a few hot tech stocks, such as Amazon and Netflix, which benefited from the lockdowns, as online shopping took off and people who were stuck at home streamed plenty of movies.  Netflix ended the year nearly 64% for the year, Amazon more than 70%.  ""In terms of the broad economic changes, these companies are on the right side of history,"" says Lu Zhang, a professor of finance at the Fisher College of Business at Ohio State University.  Tesla's wild ride and a new centibillionaire But few stocks exploded in value as much as the electric-car maker Tesla, which rose more than 700% this year, eventually getting added to the S&P 500. Even founder Elon Musk, whose Tesla shares were worth so much he became a newly minted centibillionaire, complained in May that the price was too high.  In fact, the stock market gains this year have made the rich a lot richer at a time when tens of millions of people are still struggling without jobs, and they have exacerbated the country's wealth gap.  Generation homebound and trading Some part of the rebound — there's debate about how much — was due to the explosive rise in online trading, with homebound investors filling their hours buying and selling stocks.  Online brokerage companies such as Fidelity and Charles Schwab saw massive increases in trading volume.  Then there was the stock trading app Robinhood, with its 13 million customers, many of them young people with little experience trading. And many are especially attracted to high-gloss tech stocks such as Apple and Microsoft. These superstar tech stocks helped send the overall market higher. Apple's market share even hit $2 trillion in August. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",stock trading stocks market march
