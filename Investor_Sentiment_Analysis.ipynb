Invest Now The National Pension System (NPS) fund managers\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122 schemes E (equity) have underperformed the benchmark Nifty 50 Total Return Index (TRI) over three years. \\u00c2\\u00a0Even over a five-year timeframe only one fund managed to outperform the benchmark index. These schemes have delivered 2.09-4.86 per cent returns annually during the three-year period, compared to the benchmark\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s 5.93 per cent, data from Value Research \\u00c2\\u00a0as on September 11 shows. To put things in perspective, the large-cap mutual fund category delivered 4.47 per cent over the last three years, while the returns were 8.24 per cent over the five-year period. So, even mutual funds have fallen behind the Nifty 50 TRI.  HDFC Pension Fund stars HDFC Pension Fund was the top performer with 4.86 per cent during the period, followed by Birla Sun Life Pension Scheme (4.82 per cent) and ICICI Prudential Pension Fund (4.26 per cent). SBI Pension Fund and Kotak Pension fund yielded 4.07 per cent and 3.76 per cent respectively, while LIC Pension Fund (2.09 per cent) and UTI Retirement Solutions (3.55 per cent) brought up the rear. In the five-year return category, it was again HDFC Pension Fund that grabbed the top spot with 9.42 per cent, beating the benchmark Nifty 50 TRI (9.39 per cent) in the process. Other pension fund managers\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122 schemes fetched between 6.75-8.55 per cent annually during the period, while the Nifty 50 TRI delivered 9.39 per cent .

Invest Now  The Nifty50, which reclaimed its 50-days moving average also known as short-term moving average on Thursday, gave up most of the gains and closed sharply lower on Monday. The Nifty50 broke below its crucial 50-DMA on May 4 placed around 9,800 levels. The last time when the index traded above this crucial level was in February 2020. Not just Nifty but there are over 70 percent of the stocks in the Nifty500 index that are trading below their crucial short term (50-DMA) as well as the long term moving average (200-DMA). There are as many as 361 stocks in the Nifty500 index that are trading below their 50-DMA, and 200-DMA. These\\u00a0include\\u00a0MRF, Shree Cement, Page Industries, Bajaj Finserv, UltraTech Cements, HDF AMC, Bajaj Finance, Maruti Suzuki\\u00a0and Bosch, data from AceEquity showed. Note: Here is a list of 50 stocks out of 361 in the Nifty500 index that are trading below 50, and 200-DMA.  The 50-DMA is popularly used by technical chartists to identify the trend. A close above 50-DMA and if Nifty50 manages to sustain above these levels could have open doors for the index to march towards 10,000. The moving average is used commonly by traders to interpret the trend. A move below 50-DMA is considered bearish in the intermediate-term or a trend change towards the downside while a close above the same is considered a bullish sign. Technically, the Nifty50 formed an \\u2018Island Reversal\\u2019 pattern on the daily charts on Monday which is a reversal pattern, and the next big support for the index is placed at 9250, and below that 8900-8800, suggest experts. \\u201cThe Nifty50 appears to have reversed its trend with an Island Reversal formation perhaps owing to weak global cues which were accompanied with a further extension of lockdown,\\u201d Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist \\u2013 Technical Research &amp; Trading Advisory, at Chartviewindia.in told Moneycontrol. \\u201cTechnically, indices should remain under pressure unless they close above 9732 levels. In such a scenario all pull back attempts towards 9500 levels shall be considered as an opportunity to create fresh short positions,\\u201d he said. Mohammad further added that some support on the downside can be expected around 9250 levels and breach of this minor support shall drag it down towards its near term critical support of 8900 levels breach of which shall confirm bigger downsides for this market. What should investors do? The Nifty50 moved up sharply in April largely on news about a possible breakthrough in a drug that could cure COVID-19 patients. The Nifty50 rallied by over 14 percent in April and the majority of the gains were seen in the last week. The Nifty had moved up sharply over the past few weeks by about 30 percent from its panic bottom of 7,500 to closer to 9,800 levels, but fundamentals of the economy were still weak and investors were looking for a trigger to book profits. Expectations of further escalation of a trade war between US and China, grim economic data back home, recent earnings from India Inc. have not been inspiring, zero sales in the auto sector, rise in COVID-19 cases in India and across the globe, as well as the extension of lockdown are some of the factors which weighed on sentiment. Experts feel that traders should focus on stock-specific opportunities as volatility is likely to remain high. \\u201cGoing ahead, all eyes would be on further development with respect to Donald Trump\\u2019s threat. In case of further escalation, we may see Nifty correcting towards 9100 - 9000; whereas on the flip side, 9390 followed by 9450 would be seen as immediate hurdles,\\u201d Sameet Chavan (Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives, Angel Broking) told Moneycontrol. \\u201cAs of now, we hope things do not worsen from here and Nifty manages to find support in the zone of 9250-9200 levels. Traders are advised to stay light and keep a close eye on the above-mentioned scenarios,\\u201d he said. Chavan further added that at present, individual stocks are providing good trading opportunities and hence, it\\u2019s advisable to focus on such potential candidates. Arun Kumar, Market Strategist, Reliance Securities recommends stocks such as Aarti Drugs, Alembic Pharma, Aurobindo Pharma, Biocon, Cadila Healthcare, Cipla, Divis Lab, Dr.Reddy\\u2019s Lab and Lupin which have good setup from a long-term perspective.

Digital, Healthcare and Telecom will continue to have a good run in 2021: All these themes were promising even before COVID 19 but the pandemic has resulted in business transformation decisions which were unthinkable a year back. IT companies in India are winning big transformational deals which will have huge implications over the next few years. Similarly, healthcare and telecom sectors have seen massive changes. Business models are set to evolve further and stocks in these sectors will continue to outperform in 2021.Year of small and mid caps: After a prolonged period of weakness, the small and midcap stocks have outperformed the large cap indices by a significant margin. The year 2021 will be a year of economic revival with GDP growth rate closer to double digits. Notwithstanding the low base, the economic revival will usher stronger earnings growth. In a year of strong earnings growth, mid and small caps tend to see market beating earnings growth and rerating. Small and mid cap stocks are likely to deliver very strong returns and when combined with other dominant themes then returns will be even stronger.BFSI and Atmanirbhar to see strong traction: The immense liquidity within banking system has meant that the sector is now focused on growth. NPAs are likely to be contained well and the banks have raised enough capital to tide over the stress challenges. As growth becomes the focus for banks, stock returns will track credit growth and pre provision profits which are likely to be significant. Apart from BFSI, the Union Budget for 2021 will be very critical with major schemes for manufacturing companies expected. This could mean a wide range of Atmanirbhar (self-sufficiency) schemes are in the fray. This could help the manufacturing sector immensely.Sector rotation and impetus on infrastructure will be critical: Equities have seen significant flow of FII liquidity and solid sector rotation theme playing out. Even PSUs have started performing in the last couple of months as they were immensely undervalued. Sector rotation theme is likely to play out in the early part of 2021 as underperforming sectors like FMCG could gain traction. Also, budget could put more thrust on the infrastructure sector as that is the key for creating jobs. Thus, sector rotation and selective plays related to infra could deliver good returns in 2021.

We expect moderation in monetary policies and rising yields scenario in 2HCY21, which will lead to mean reversion of valuations towards 10/15 year averages. Based on these thesis we have used the previous 15 years peak of 19x Fw PE multiple to value the Nifty-50 to derive at our CY21 end target. We expect Nifty-50 to end CY21 somewhere around 13,500 and BSE Sensex to end at about 46,000.\\\" B Gopkumar, MD & CEO, Axis Securities, \\\"The year 2020 was a rollercoaster ride, to say the least. The stock markets in 2020 witnessed a fascinating trend. As the market corrected significantly, retail investors started buying quality stocks realizing the value in these companies. Also, lockdown resulted in more people taking to the equity markets and learning nuances. This shift has significant long term implications as more and more participants will be seen in 2021. The year 2020 also showed us the resilience of the Indian economy. We performed much better than most developed countries that have far superior health care facilities. Even with a lockdown in place, the Indian corporates managed their cost structure very well and adapted to the conditions better than expectations. India has seen multiple shocks over the last 15 years, due to which the economy has become more resilient, and the pandemic has made it even more resilient. 2021 will be a year of growth. We expect the GDP growth rate in 2021 to be closer to double digits, and earnings growth to be 30%+ for India Inc. Union Budget in 2021 could also be a blockbuster. Putting these perspectives together, we are likely to see a robust 2021.\\\" Catch all the Business News ,  Market News , Breaking News Events and Latest News  Updates on Live Mint.
